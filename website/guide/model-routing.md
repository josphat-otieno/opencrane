# Model routing

Instead of wiring each agent to one hard-coded model, register the models your organisation is
allowed to use, and let OpenCrane resolve which one a given run actually calls. Every model call
goes through **LiteLLM**, a self-hosted proxy that fronts your chosen providers, so a raw provider
API key never reaches a runtime container — agents only ever hold a short-lived key scoped to one
model and one spending limit.

## Register models

Use the authenticated `/api/v1/models` surface to list and manage model definitions.
Definitions refer to provider credentials held by OpenCrane; raw provider keys do not enter
runtime Jobs.

## Set defaults

`/api/v1/model-routing/defaults` lists and updates defaults by scope and `ClusterTenant`.
Global defaults are operator-only. Organisation-scoped defaults require the matching
authorisation boundary.

When OpenCrane admits a run, it resolves the model route and records it in the
`RunInputSnapshot`. The controller then receives an attempt-scoped LiteLLM key limited to the
selected alias, budget and expiry.

::: tip
Changing a default affects future admissions. It does not change the model route frozen into
an existing run.

Automated evaluation cases, savings measurements and approval proposals are not mounted in
the current server composition.
