/**
 * Per-org domain provisioning seam (fixed-wildcard topology).
 *
 * When an org (ClusterTenant) is created, it becomes addressable at its derived apex
 * `<name>.<platformBaseDomain>` and its users at `<user>.<name>.<base>`. Two
 * cluster-side side effects must follow:
 *   1. DNS — a per-org wildcard record `*.<name>.<base>` → the cluster ingress IP, so
 *      every UserTenant gateway host under the org resolves with no per-user record.
 *   2. TLS — a per-org wildcard Certificate `*.<name>.<base>` (cert-manager DNS-01),
 *      because the platform `*.<base>` cert does NOT cover the extra label
 *      `<user>.<name>.<base>` (DNS wildcards match exactly one label).
 *
 * This module defines ONLY the interface. The concrete implementation — and the
 * ClusterTenant operator/CR watcher that CALLS it on the `pending → ready` reconcile
 * — is a SEPARATE workstream (the cluster-tenants operator track) and is intentionally
 * NOT built here. The control-plane create flow
 * (`routes/cluster-tenants.ts → _createClusterTenant`) persists desired state and
 * hands off to that reconciler; the reconciler invokes `provisionOrgDomain(...)`.
 *
 * Keeping this an interface (no live cert-manager / Cloud DNS calls in the create
 * path) preserves the API-first, fail-closed posture: a malformed or unauthorised
 * create never reaches DNS or TLS issuance, and the side effects are idempotent and
 * separately ownable.
