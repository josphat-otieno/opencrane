/**
 * Runs a resilient Kubernetes watch loop with automatic reconnects.
 *
 * ## What is a Kubernetes watch loop?
 *
 * The Kubernetes API server supports a `?watch=true` query parameter on list
 * endpoints. Instead of returning a snapshot and closing, it holds the HTTP
 * connection open and streams newline-delimited JSON events as resources
 * change. Each event has a `type` (`Added`, `Modified`, `Deleted`) and the
 * full resource body. This is how controllers react to changes in real time
 * without polling.
 *
 * ## Why does it need reconnects?
 *
 * The watch stream is not permanent. The API server closes it after a
 * server-defined timeout (typically 5–10 minutes, controlled by
 * `--min-request-timeout`). Network interruptions, pod restarts, and API
 * server upgrades also drop the connection. A production operator must detect
 * the closed stream and re-establish it immediately, otherwise it silently
 * stops receiving events and diverges from the desired state of the cluster.
 *
 * ## What this function does
 *
 * 1. Opens a watch stream against the given API `path`.
 * 2. Forwards each incoming event to the caller's `onEvent` handler.
 * 3. When the stream closes normally (no error), schedules a reconnect after
 *    `retryDelayMs` milliseconds — the normal end-of-watch-window case.
 * 4. When the stream closes with an error, logs the error and schedules the
 *    same reconnect — the network-failure case.
 * 5. When watch setup itself throws (CRD not yet registered, RBAC denied,
 *    etc.), logs and retries with the same backoff.
 *
 * The result is a self-healing loop: the caller just awaits this function and
 * relies on `onEvent` being called indefinitely, regardless of transient
 * cluster disruptions.
