# Deployment infrastructure

> [OpenCrane](../../README.md) › [apps](../README.md) › _infra

`apps/_infra` contains deployment-only applications and the Kubernetes release composer. These
projects own third-party version pins, Helm resources, workload identity, network policy, storage,
and deployment smoke contracts. They do not own OpenCrane business rules: the functional libraries
listed below own how the product uses each service.

## Service map

| Deployment | What OpenCrane uses it for | Functional areas | OpenCrane integration owners |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`cognee`](./cognee/) | Durable organisation memory and indexed knowledge. | Knowledge, memory, authorization, and sharing. | [`retrieval`](../../libs/backend/server/knowledge/retrieval/main/), [`grants`](../../libs/backend/server/iam/grants/main/), [agent memory](../../libs/backend/agents/memory/main/), and [personal-memory selection](../../libs/backend/agents/personal/memory/main/). |
| [`litellm`](./litellm/) | The model gateway for provider credentials, model registration, routing, budgets, and usage accounting. | Models and economics; governed runtime access. | [`model-routing`](../../libs/backend/server/gateways/model-routing/main/), [`providers`](../../libs/backend/server/gateways/providers/main/), and [`spend`](../../libs/backend/server/reporting/spend/main/). |
| [`obot`](./obot/) | Model Context Protocol (MCP) credential custody and the gateway through which agents reach external tools. | Tools, integrations, and runtime action delivery. | [`mcp`](../../libs/backend/server/gateways/mcp/main/) owns MCP registration; [`integrations`](../../libs/backend/server/gateways/integrations/main/) owns connection and credential-custody references. |
| [`deploy-k8s`](./deploy-k8s/) | The installation entrypoint that composes the OpenCrane apps and the three deployment units above into one Kubernetes release. | Platform operations and release composition across all functional areas. | [`apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform`](../../apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform/) supplies shared Helm templates, deployment scripts, and cluster provisioning. [`apps/opencrane`](../opencrane/) owns the target database baseline; [`apps/postgres`](../postgres/) applies it during clean CNPG setup. |

## Ownership rule

Add deployment configuration here only when it belongs to a rendered workload or release
composition. Put reusable application behaviour under the matching `libs/backend/server` domain,
server-process infrastructure under `libs/backend/server/infra`, and Kubernetes release mechanisms under
`apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform`. A third-party deployment may be replaced without moving its
OpenCrane functional contract out of those libraries.
