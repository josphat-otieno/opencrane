# @opencrane/backend/agents/execution/inputs — run input snapshot assembly

## What it owns

This package is part of the **shared execution flow** used by both personal and managed agents.
Before an agent runtime executes a run, the platform freezes *everything* that run is allowed to see
and use into one immutable record — the
**`RunInputSnapshot`**: which messages, which persona, which memory facts, which tools and budgets,
and which verified identity. This package owns the **assembly** of that snapshot: it gathers each
input from an injected authority, validates the combination, and hands the finished snapshot to the
run-admission transaction that persists it. After that instant nothing about the run's input can
change — a retry, an audit, or a replay all see the exact same record, identified by its digest
(a SHA-256 fingerprint of the canonical content).

```

 runs · RunAdmissionRepository  ── persists run + snapshot + outbox events in one commit
```

**In this flow:** [execution/runs](../../runs/main/README.md) *(owns the admission transaction, the digest
function, and the durable rows)* · [membership](../../../../server/iam/membership/main/README.md)
*(supplies the signed fleet-membership evidence behind the identity envelope)*

Every input is loaded through a port (`RunAuthoritySource`, `ApprovedPersonaSource`, …) inside the
**same database transaction** that admits the run, so a permission revoked or a membership expired a
millisecond before commit can never leak into the frozen record. In particular, the required
`SkillRevisionEligibilitySource` locks every skill assignment and verifies that each skill returned
after effective-grant intersection is an assigned, same-silo, still-published, non-revoked revision. One refusal anywhere denies the
whole assembly with a single precise reason; a duplicate request (same idempotency key) returns the
previously admitted snapshot without recompiling anything.

Third-party tools enter the snapshot as revision-selected integration assignments, each containing
only an integration identifier and its allowed tool names. The assembler never receives a custody
credential or an old MCP grant: the later action boundary resolves the live custody reference and
checks the same revision assignment again.

Invariant: a run either commits with its one complete, digest-sealed input snapshot, or it does not
exist — there is no partially assembled state, and no snapshot field originates from unverified
caller input.

## Public surface

- `__AssembleRunInputSnapshot(command, authorities)` — the end-to-end assembly: validate → load all
  sources inside the admission transaction → compile, digest, and persist.
- `ManagedExecutionIdentityEnvelopeSource` — adapts the agent-service authority's current signed
  fleet-membership and effective non-personal scope evidence into a tagged `service` identity. Its
  canonical `agent-service:<id>` principal must match the admitted service; a requester never
  becomes that service's execution identity.
- `__CreatePrismaManagedSessionAssemblyAuthorities` — composes the package-private production
  readers with the caller-owned identity and final skill-eligibility authorities.
- `__CreatePrismaPersonalSessionAssemblyAuthorities` — composes the corresponding personal-run
  readers, including one transaction-scoped personal-memory repository shared by the preference
  and memory-scope sources. It freezes only the verified user's active Cognee dataset identifier
  and consented catalog fact identifiers; it never reads fact content or calls Cognee.
- `PersonalExecutionIdentityEnvelopeSource` — selects the sole current personal-scope assertion
  from signed fleet membership, re-reads that exact verified revision after its high-watermark is
  advanced, and digests the user's still-valid, unrevoked personal grants in the admission
  transaction. Browser input never selects the organisation, assertion, or capabilities.
- `PrismaSkillRevisionEligibilitySource` — locks the AgentRevision's skill assignments
  at admission and refuses an invented, foreign, revoked, or unpublished revision with
  `skill_unavailable`.
- `AssembleRunInputSnapshotResult` / `SessionAssemblyRefusalReason` — the all-or-nothing outcome and
  its refusal vocabulary.
- `__CompileRunInput` / `__AppendCompiledTool` — deterministic expansion of a sealed snapshot into
  runtime-owned prompt input, with a version stamp that makes a compiler change visible in evidence.
- `PromptCompilerRepositories` — injected read ports used only to dereference snapshot-authorized
  content while compiling.

All other source adapters and assembly ports are package-private implementation details. Same-package
tests import their owning modules directly; adding a test does not widen this barrel.

## Boundary

Consumed by the run-admission path in the OpenCrane app, which composes the ports with real
authority adapters. It does not select a runtime driver, approve a persona, issue capabilities, or
read mutable workspace files — and it never touches storage directly: every read goes through a
port, and the only write goes through the [runs](../../runs/main/README.md) package's
`RunAdmissionRepository`. The deterministic compiler reads only content already named by the sealed
snapshot; it cannot add a new tool, memory record, or policy. Fail-closed throughout: malformed coordinates, a stale membership, a
non-canonical digest, or any single source refusal denies the run.

The OpenCrane app composes both managed and personal admission variants. The personal route derives
the subject and silo from the authenticated session and host, resolves the participant-bound thread
and AgentService server-side, verifies the exact signed membership assertion with the mounted
Ed25519 key ring, and computes the capability digest in the admission transaction. Its
`POST /api/v1/me/runs` body contains only `threadId` and `requestIdempotencyKey`—never user, silo,
service, dataset, memory fact, or membership coordinates.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `scope:execution-inputs`: it may depend only on `scope:agents`, `scope:agent-services`,
`scope:artifacts`, `scope:authorization`, `scope:membership`, `scope:personal-memory`, `scope:execution-runs`,
`scope:execution-inputs`, and `scope:shared` — never on apps or unrelated domains. The
agent-services dependency is one-way: this package consumes managed-service evidence but never
decides service publication, membership, grant, or scope attachment policy.
