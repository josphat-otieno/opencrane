# Review Gate Policy

This file is the **single tunable surface** for the automated review gate. When the
gate fires too often (burning tokens) or misses things, edit this file — nothing else.

Two consumers read it:
- `.claude/hooks/require-review.sh` (free shell pre-filter) reads the machine-config
  block below to cheaply skip the obvious cases.
- The Haiku `Stop` agent hook reads the **Judgment guidance** prose to decide the
  ambiguous middle.

---

## Machine config (parsed by the shell pre-filter)

Keep this block's format stable: `key=value`, space-separated tokens. Edit the values,
not the keys.

<!-- GATE-CONFIG-START -->
threshold=10
always-review=auth token secret credential oidc iam rbac networkpolicy network-policy egress middleware bearer session budget spend payment
never-review-paths=__tests__/ .test.ts .spec.ts .types.ts /generated/ /dist/
<!-- GATE-CONFIG-END -->

- **threshold** — TypeScript changes of this many total lines or fewer skip the gate
  (unless an `always-review` keyword matches). Raise it to review less; lower to review more.
- **always-review** — case-insensitive keywords. If any changed file path or diff line
  contains one, the change is escalated to the Haiku judge regardless of size.
- **never-review-paths** — path substrings. If *every* changed file matches one of these,
  the change is skipped without invoking the judge.

## Judgment guidance (read by the Haiku judge)

You are deciding whether a TypeScript change needs an independent `@review` pass before
the turn ends. Block (`ok:false`) only when the change carries real risk. Allow (`ok:true`)
otherwise — over-blocking wastes tokens.

**Block when the change involves any of:**
- Authentication / authorization logic, token validation, session handling, OIDC flows.
- Secret, credential, or API-key handling.
- Network boundaries: NetworkPolicy, egress rules, routes added without auth middleware.
- IAM / RBAC grants or trust bindings.
- Money: budget, spend, or billing logic.
- Non-trivial control flow in production code (new branching, error handling, retries,
  concurrency) where a subtle bug would cause incorrect behaviour or data loss.

**Allow (skip review) when the change is:**
- Comments, JSDoc, logging, or formatting only.
- Test files, fixtures, or type-only declarations.
- Mechanical renames or import reordering with no behavioural change.
- A small, self-contained change with an obvious, low-risk effect.

When genuinely uncertain on a production-code change, lean toward blocking — a Haiku
judgment is far cheaper than a regression reaching `main`.

## Tuning log

Record changes here so the feedback loop is visible to the team.

- _(initial)_ threshold=10; always-review covers auth/secret/network/iam/money; tests,
  type-only, and generated code are skipped.
