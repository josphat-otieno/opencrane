/**
 * Manages the per-tenant AES encryption key Secret lifecycle.
 *
 * Each tenant gets a unique 256-bit (32-byte) encryption key stored as a
 * Kubernetes Secret. The key is used by the OpenClaw gateway process to
 * encrypt tenant-specific secrets stored in the GCS-backed state directory.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - Keys are generated once on first reconcile and never rotated automatically.
 *   Automatic rotation would require re-encrypting all tenant secrets, which
 *   needs a coordinated migration, not just a Secret update.
 * - Keys are stored in a dedicated named Secret (`openclaw-<name>-encryption-key`)
 *   rather than bundled into a shared Secret. This enables per-tenant RBAC
 *   so the operator can grant each pod access only to its own key Secret.
 * - The key is mounted as a file (`/etc/openclaw/encryption-key/key`) rather
 *   than env var to avoid exposure in `ps aux` or crash reports.
