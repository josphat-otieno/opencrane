1. Executive Summary — 2-paragraph thesis on Q3 goals

4. Resourcing — headcount plan, contractor budget, cross-team dependencies

Want me to draft any of these in full? I'd suggest starting with section 3 since that's where the trade-offs are.`

I've also flagged Enterprise Pilot as at-risk because it depends on Data Export hitting Aug 30. If that slips, the pilot timeline collapses. Worth surfacing to the VP now rather than in the Sep 15 review.`

[Interview 1 - Priya, growth lead]
Main frustration: "I spend 20 min every Monday pulling the same Jira report. I know exactly what I want, I just can't automate it without eng help."
Job: get weekly status without meetings or manual work.

[Interview 2 - Dan, account exec]
"I use it once a week, mostly to prep for customer calls. Feels like a lot of setup for what I need."
Job: look credible in front of a customer in 10 min or less.

[Interview 3 - Sunita, eng lead]
"The context window stuff is annoying. I have to re-explain my project every time."
Job: have a working session where the AI already knows the situation.

[Interview 4 - Karl, ops manager]
"I tried it twice, got confused by the skill setup, left."
Job: get a quick answer without reading a manual.`

				[{
					type: MessageCardKind.Text,
					content: `Good data. Here's the synthesis across these four — I'll flag where I'm extrapolating vs. where the notes clearly support the finding.

**Core JTBD split**

Power users (Priya, Sunita) have a recurring, well-defined job: automate a specific workflow they already understand, and maintain context across sessions. They tolerate setup cost if the payoff is reliable.

Casual users (Dan, Karl) have a one-shot job: get a credible output quickly without investment. For them, setup friction is a showstopper, not a trade-off.

**Key tension**
Priya and Sunita are frustrated by things that don't exist yet (automation pipelines, persistent context). Dan and Karl are frustrated by things that do exist but are too complex to discover. These are almost opposite problems — fixing one without acknowledging the other risks alienating both segments.

**Outlier to flag**
Karl left after two sessions. This is a churn signal, not a feature request. If casual users aren't reaching a value moment in the first session, no amount of feature work fixes retention.

**What I'd recommend next**
Split the 12 interviews explicitly into power/casual before theming further — otherwise the average will mislead you. Do you have a signal I could use to classify the remaining 8 (e.g. session frequency, role type)?`
