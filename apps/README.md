# Apps — the deployables

> [OpenCrane](../README.md) › apps

Everything here is a **deployable**: a thing that ships and runs — a server, a single-page app, a
worker, a database. Apps are thin. They compose libraries, wire up clients, and manage process
lifecycle; the actual product logic lives in [`libs`](../libs/backend/README.md). The rule is
**one `apps/<name>` per deployable, and logic lives in libs** — if you are writing behaviour worth
testing on its own, it belongs in a library, not here.

## Map

| Deployable | What it owns |
| --- | --- |
| [`opencrane`](./opencrane/README.md) | The organisation control plane and authenticated REST API. |
| [`opencrane-ui`](./opencrane-ui/README.md) | The org-admin single-page app. |
| [`channel-proxy`](./channel-proxy/README.md) | The inbound-channel edge trust boundary. |
| [`memory-gateway`](./memory-gateway/README.md) | The private authenticated boundary in front of Cognee. |
| [`artifact-service`](./artifact-service/README.md) | The artifact promote-and-receipt service. |
| [`artifact-preprocessor`](./artifact-preprocessor/README.md) | Outbound-only PDF-to-text worker behind the OpenCrane artifact broker. |
| [`agent-runtime`](./agent-runtime/README.md) | Outbound-only personal-agent process prepared as one suspended Job per run attempt. |
| [`managed-agent-runtime`](./managed-agent-runtime/README.md) | Chart/deploy-only plane for scheduled and triggered managed agents. |
| [`agent-controller`](./agent-controller/README.md) | Sole Kubernetes mutator for personal-runtime attempt resources. |
| [`skill-authoring`](./skill-authoring/README.md) | Chart-only isolated candidate-skill Job plane with no standing worker. |
| [`tool-runner`](./tool-runner/README.md) | Chart-only isolated tenant-tool Job plane with no standing worker. |
| [`postgres`](./postgres/README.md) | The durable PostgreSQL deployable. |

Vendored third-party infrastructure (Cognee, LiteLLM, Obot, and the Kubernetes release
composer) lives one level down under [`apps/_infra`](./_infra/README.md) — see that index for the
service map.

## Dependency rule for this tier

Apps carry `type:app` / `scope:app`. An app may compose any library, but it must **not** import
another app — deployables never depend on each other's source.

## Container publishing

An app that publishes a container owns its complete release descriptor on its NX `container`
target: `metadata.release.image` is the registry suffix and `metadata.release.dockerfile` is the
build definition. The Docker workflow selects affected `container` targets from NX, reads those
descriptors from their app projects, and fails closed if either field is absent. A `container`
target therefore runs the actual image build; an image smoke check is a distinct app target.

## Release compatibility

Every Nx application records `metadata.release.adaptedVersion`, the root repository version in
which that deployable was last directly adapted. App package and Helm chart versions mirror that
stamp. Unchanged apps intentionally retain older stamps; [`releases`](../releases/README.md) records
the exact app/chart/database combination for each repository train. Directly touching an app means
updating its stamp and any required Helm or database transition in the same slice.
