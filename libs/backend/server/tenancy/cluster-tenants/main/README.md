## What it owns

A **ClusterTenant** identifies one customer organisation and the silo that contains its OpenCrane
data and services. This package supplies the authorization guard that prevents callers from
mutating resources owned by another organisation.

```
 authenticated organisation request
                    │ targeted resource scope
                    ▼
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ cluster-tenants  ◄── HERE            │
 │ resolve caller membership · compare │
 └───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                 │ allow or deny
                 ▼
       authenticated domain capabilities
```

Caller scope is derived from verified identity and stored membership, never from a caller-supplied
organisation name. Missing, ambiguous, or mismatched evidence produces a denial.

## Public surface

- `_ClusterTenantScopeGuard` / `_ResolveCallerClusterTenant` — enforce organisation ownership for
  mutations.

## Boundary

Consumed by organisation-scoped domain routes. It checks caller scope; it does not own agent, run,
membership, provisioning, or provider behaviour.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `scope:cluster-tenants`: it may depend only on `scope:auth`, `scope:cluster-tenants`,
`scope:k8s-api`, and `scope:shared` — never on apps or sibling domains.

## Data & persistence

Organisation membership is stored in PostgreSQL and supplies the evidence used by the guard.
