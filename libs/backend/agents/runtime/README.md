# Runtime — language-neutral agent execution boundaries

> [backend](../../README.md) › [agents](../README.md) › runtime

The runtime group owns the Kubernetes-specific support between canonical OpenCrane state and a
process that executes an agent. The sibling execution protocol admits commands and candidates; this
group constructs the Job and controls its exact assignment, release, and first-Pod registration.
Authenticated bootstrap exchange, model/tool-loop execution, and durable transcript ownership remain
later boundaries.

## Map

| Package | What it owns |
| --- | --- |
| [`execution/protocol`](../execution/protocol/README.md) | Admission of runtime commands and candidate output against the current durable attempt authority. |
| [`k8s-launcher`](./k8s-launcher/README.md) | Pure suspended Job construction for the dedicated runtime namespace. |
| [`controller`](./controller/README.md) | Crash-safe assignment, UID-fenced Job release, and exact first-Pod registration. |
| [`cleanup`](./cleanup/main/README.md) | Exact Job checks and UID-preconditioned deletion after durable cleanup claims. |

```

The boundary is language-neutral: a Python, TypeScript, or future runtime must satisfy the same
versioned command, assignment, sequence, issuance/expiry, lease, and replay rules. Kubernetes types
stay isolated in the `layer:infra` launcher rather than leaking into those core decisions.

## Dependency rule for this tier

The launcher may consume Kubernetes manifest types but performs no input/output. The controller and
cleanup libraries may depend on that launcher and shared contracts; neither imports the app that
composes it. Cleanup implements the execution/runs physical store contract structurally, preserving
the backend-to-infrastructure dependency direction. Runtime packages do not import a model driver.
Canonical run/event persistence remains in its owning backend domain.

Each package barrel is a composition boundary: it exposes runnable factories and required policy
types, while reconciliation seams, Kubernetes client ports, response decoders, and manifest
protocol details remain owned inside their package.
