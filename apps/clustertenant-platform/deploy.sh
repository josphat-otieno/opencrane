# OpenCrane — per-ClusterTenant SILO deploy profile (S6 / ADR 0002)
#
# A thin profile over the shared install core (k8s-deploy.sh). It installs ONE
# per-ClusterTenant silo — the dedicated stack a single ClusterTenant runs on shared
# nodes: its own operator + Obot + skill-registry + LiteLLM + Cognee + control-plane +
# per-CT networking + a per-CT database (one CNPG cluster IN THIS SILO'S NAMESPACE,
# serving the silo control-plane + its planes), with self-service manager/billing OFF.
#
# The CLUSTER-WIDE infra (ingress-nginx, external-dns, the CloudNativePG operator,
# cert-manager) is installed ONCE by the CENTRAL release (apps/fleet-platform/deploy.sh); a
# silo reuses it, so this profile passes --no-ingress-nginx --no-external-dns
# --no-db-operator and does not re-install cert-manager. The silo's own namespaced
# resources (its CNPG Cluster CR, planes, per-org ingress + Certificate) are still
# applied and reconciled by the cluster-wide operators.
#
# The self-service ClusterTenant manager + billing are OFF (a silo serves exactly one
# ClusterTenant; the fleet is managed by the central super-admin control-plane).
#
# Usage:
#   apps/clustertenant-platform/deploy.sh \
#       --base-domain dev.opencrane.ai \
#       --cluster-tenant acme \
#       [--namespace opencrane-acme] [--ingress-ip 34.1.2.3] \
#       [ANY k8s-deploy.sh flag]
#
# --base-domain and --cluster-tenant are required. The silo is installed into namespace
# `opencrane-<cluster-tenant>` unless --namespace overrides it. When --ingress-ip is
# omitted the core auto-derives it from the cluster-wide ingress-nginx LoadBalancer.
#
# Prereqs: kubectl (pointed at the target cluster) and helm; the CENTRAL release already
# installed (it brings up the cluster-wide infra this silo reuses).
