# agent-runtime — the isolated personal-agent process

> [apps](../README.md) › agent-runtime

<!-- No import alias: this Python application is a deployable process, not an importable package. -->

## What it owns

The agent runtime is the process in which one personal-agent attempt will eventually execute. It
runs inside the customer's dedicated runtime Kubernetes namespace, opens its own authenticated
connection to OpenCrane in the separate server namespace, and never accepts inbound network traffic.

The agent controller creates the fresh, initially suspended Job from durable run authority, releases
the exact assigned Job, and registers its first Pod. This process then binds its per-run public proof
key with a one-use bootstrap exchange, opens its command stream, and executes each `start_attempt`
command as a bounded Pydantic AI model/tool loop over the per-silo LiteLLM proxy, reporting normalized
candidates as the attempt runs. A model tool call is surfaced as a bounded `external_action`
candidate for the control plane to authorize — the runtime never executes an unapproved tool. It also
handles `resume_attempt` (the control plane names WHICH proposed tool calls were approved; the
runtime executes each approved integration call directly against Obot's MCP proxy with an
attempt-scoped key, reports a digest-only `tool.completed` candidate, and feeds the results back
into the paused loop) and `cancel_attempt` (a positive signal that kills the active task while the server retains the
canonical cancellation outcome), absorbs steering only at pre-model-request boundaries, and writes an encrypted,
version-tagged, replaceable local checkpoint subordinate to canonical server state.

Invariant: this process cannot choose its user, agent revision, run, tools, permissions, or durable
state. A failed or retried attempt receives a different Job identity, and runtime-local files
disappear with its bounded scratch volume. If identity or server authority is unavailable, the
process reconnects with bounded backoff and does no work. The runtime namespace may never collapse
into the OpenCrane server namespace.

## Public surface

`Entrypoint: src/runtime.py` is a thin composition root. It loads the process settings, binds
per-run public proof-key evidence, completes the one-use bootstrap, and maintains the outbound
command stream. Five focused components collaborate beneath it:

```text
runtime.py
├── bootstrap ───────────────► transport/http
└── transport/stream ────────► attempts
                                ├── model_loop
                                └── protocol
```

`src/bootstrap/` owns proof binding, `src/transport/` owns control-plane I/O, `src/attempts/` executes
commands, `src/model_loop/` adapts the bounded model loop, and `src/protocol/` projects stable
candidates. The [source architecture](src/README.md) follows the complete runtime sequence and
records the dependency, authority, retry, cancellation, and checkpoint rules in one place.

The stream rejects any individual response line above 64 KiB and executes each `start_attempt`
command as a bounded Pydantic AI model/tool loop. The loop reaches the LiteLLM proxy only through an
attempt-scoped virtual key mounted as a group-readable Secret, performs zero implicit retries, and is
driven with `agent.iter()` and per-node `node.stream(run.ctx)` calls (never the `run_stream()`
final-output shortcut).
Raw framework events are normalized into stable protocol candidates while the attempt is active:
output text, usage, and errors become bounded `event` candidates, while a model tool call becomes a
bounded `external_action` candidate whose `toolRevisionId` is resolved from the compiled grant set
and whose `argumentsDigest` is a deterministic `sha256:<hex>` the control plane re-derives. Pydantic
AI types, ids, and checkpoints never cross that seam. Resume delivers control-plane approval
decisions (`{approvalRequestId, decision, toolInvocationId}`): the runtime maps each approved
decision back to its recorded pending call, re-checks the compiled allow-list and Obot addressing,
executes it against `/mcp-connect/<serverId>/mcp` with the mounted attempt key (`src/tools/obot_mcp.py`),
reports `tool.completed { toolInvocationId, resultDigest }`, and feeds only the resulting per-call
mapping into the framework; a denial feeds an explicit refusal and every failure is a typed loop
error, never a fabricated result. Cancel is a positive signal that suppresses any late candidate; steering is
absorbed only at the safe pre-model-request boundary. Any executor failure surfaces as a real
`run.failed` terminal report rather than a silent acknowledgement, and a dropped stream bounds further
candidate emission. Non-terminal replay is allowed only for the control plane's explicit bounded
pre-reservation response: the runtime resubmits that exact candidate id until the server accepts it,
exhausts its durable retry budget, or the active attempt/stream is cancelled. A terminal candidate
may also replay unchanged after an ambiguous network loss because the server may already have
persisted it; an explicit HTTP refusal is never retried.

## Boundary

The process has no listener, Service, Ingress, Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC), model
provider credential, tool implementation, artifact credential, database client, or persistent tenant
mount. It does not decide which run it may execute; OpenCrane validates the exact Job, Pod,
ServiceAccount, attempt, and revision before admitting work.

It also has no static Helm workload. Installing one shared Deployment would blur user and attempt
identity, so the image may run only as the fresh Job contract defined by this slice. Durable memory
or artifacts must cross an authenticated OpenCrane service boundary rather than remaining inside the
runtime.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `type:app`, `layer:entrypoint`, and `scope:agent-runtime`. It is a deployable process at the top
of the dependency graph; libraries do not import it. The wire contract is owned by
`@opencrane/contracts`, and the server-side transport is owned by `libs/backend/server/infra`.

## Runtime & config

- `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_STREAM_URL` — exact in-cluster OpenCrane base endpoint; the process appends
  `/bootstrap`, `/stream`, and `/candidates`.
- `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_TOKEN_PATH` — rotating audience-bound projected-token path.
- `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_BOOTSTRAP_PATH` — path of the projected bootstrap-reference file (defaults to
  `/var/run/opencrane/bootstrap/reference`).
- `POD_UID` — immutable Pod identity supplied through the Kubernetes downward API.
- `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_LITELLM_BASE_URL` — in-cluster LiteLLM proxy base URL the bounded loop calls.
- `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_LITELLM_KEY_PATH` — path of the mounted attempt-scoped LiteLLM key (defaults to
  `/var/run/opencrane/litellm/key`).
- `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_OBOT_URL` / `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_OBOT_KEY_PATH` — optional in-cluster Obot MCP
  base origin and mounted attempt-scoped Obot key path (`/var/run/opencrane/obot/key`). Both absent
  means direct execution is unavailable and an approved integration tool fails with a typed loop
  error. The key is server-scoped and lease-expiring; never the Obot service credential.
- `OPENCRANE_RUNTIME_CHECKPOINT_DIR` — directory for the encrypted local resume checkpoint (defaults
  to `/tmp/opencrane/checkpoints`).
- `/var/run/opencrane/bootstrap/reference` — read-only opaque lookup reference projected from the
  Pod annotation. It is not a credential and is never placed in an environment variable or argument.
- `/var/run/opencrane/litellm/key` — the attempt-scoped LiteLLM virtual key, projected as a
  group-readable (`0440`) Secret volume. It is never the master key, never a provider secret, and
  never a plaintext environment variable.
- `/tmp/opencrane/checkpoints/checkpoint.enc` — the replaceable encrypted local checkpoint. It is a
  subordinate optimisation only, never durable state and never a source of truth.
- Writable storage is only a per-attempt `emptyDir` capped at 1 GiB and mounted at `/tmp`.
- Third-party dependencies are `cryptography` (P-256 proof-key generation) and
  `pydantic-ai-slim[openai]` (the bounded model/tool loop), both pinned in `deploy/requirements.txt`;
  the standard library covers everything else.

The Job builder requires an immutable image digest plus bounded CPU, memory, deadline, and scratch.
The container runs as numeric user and group `65532` with a read-only root filesystem. Its projected
credential is group-readable (`0440`) only by that runtime group; it is never world-readable.

## Status

The current image proves identity, the one-use bootstrap exchange, durable command dispatch, and a
bounded model/tool loop: it binds its proof key, receives its fenced `start_attempt`,
`resume_attempt`, and `cancel_attempt` commands with its control-plane-compiled literal input, and
completes a real agent run over LiteLLM through an attempt-scoped key. It surfaces model tool calls as
`external_action` candidates for server-side authorization, executes approved integration calls
directly against Obot with the attempt-scoped key (digest-only receipts; live-Obot qualification
remains gated on issue #337), kills the active task on a positive cancel signal, absorbs steering at pre-model-request
boundaries, and writes an encrypted, version-tagged, replaceable local checkpoint subordinate to
canonical server state. The controller creates or exact-adopts the suspended Job, releases the durable
assignment, and registers the unique first Pod. The offline conformance harness and fault-injection
matrix (`tests/test_conformance.py`, `tests/test_fault_matrix.py`) are built and CI-runnable. The
same conformance contract is used for live LiteLLM qualification.
