"""Orchestrate fenced attempt commands across model, protocol, and transport seams.

This module owns per-command control flow, not durable run authority. It validates enough structure
to bind candidates, starts or resumes the neutral model-event source, projects each event through the
protocol seam, and asks ``TerminalGate`` to deliver one local completion/failure. Cancellation only
signals local work to stop; the server owns the canonical cancelled state.
