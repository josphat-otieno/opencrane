# postgres — durable PostgreSQL deployable

> [apps](../README.md) › postgres

<!-- No `@opencrane/*` import alias: this deployable is a Helm chart that wraps a vendored
     database operator. Titled by its `project.json` name (`postgres`). -->

This is a **vendored-infra deployable**: OpenCrane does not write its own database, it runs the
third-party [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) (CNPG) PostgreSQL operator and wraps it in a Helm
chart we own. This app owns that wrapper — the desired database shape and its network boundary — while
CNPG owns the running database. It is the single durable data store every silo depends on.

## What it owns

A **silo** is one customer's isolated slice of OpenCrane. This chart declares the silo's database:
**one** CNPG `Cluster` holding several logical databases, a bounded CNPG-managed PgBouncer pooler,
expandable mounted storage, ingress isolation, and optional plugin-based backup/recovery. Application
data is retained indefinitely; the Cluster survives Helm uninstall, and deleting a database is an
explicit operator action, never a release side-effect.

It sits beneath everything else in the silo — the server, LiteLLM, and Obot each get their
own logical database inside the shared Cluster, and each authenticates only to its own:

```

   CloudNativePG operator (vendor)    opencrane server · litellm · obot
```

**In this flow:** [opencrane server](../opencrane/README.md) ·
[litellm](../_infra/litellm/README.md) · [obot](../_infra/obot/README.md)

CNPG bootstraps the first database from one immutable, content-addressed ConfigMap containing the
OpenCrane-owned target SQL, then declaratively reconciles the remaining least-privilege roles and
`Database` custom resources. The publisher prepends `SET ROLE` for the configured first-database
owner, so CNPG's bootstrap superuser never becomes the owner of application objects. Each application role can authenticate only to its own database —
there are no shared owner roles or credentials. A separate operational administrator can connect to
every logical database for monitoring and investigation, but cannot durably write application data,
change persistent schemas, bypass row-level security, create databases/roles, or act as a superuser.
It does receive PostgreSQL's temporary-object privilege for operational queries. Its credential is
never reused by an application. Deployment publishes a separate administrator connection Secret
for explicit operator access; no application workload consumes it. One connection Secret per
database is published by
`scripts/publish-app-connection-secret.sh`, which adds the `uri` without sharing credentials across
authorities or leaking them into command arguments or logs. Clean setup publishes the baseline with
`scripts/publish-initdb-baseline-config-map.sh`; physical recovery does not execute that SQL because
the backup already contains the schema and its protected, superuser-owned baseline marker. The
privileges hook verifies that in-database marker before application deployment can continue.
It retries transient CNPG rollout disconnects within a fixed shell budget, applies each privilege
batch in one transaction, and leaves a short Job-deadline grace period for the final PostgreSQL
diagnostic. A persistent failure still blocks the Helm hook.

The pooler is deliberately part of the data boundary rather than an optional optimisation. Its default
budget permits at most ten server connections per logical database (thirty across the deployed
databases) while PostgreSQL permits eighty. The OpenCrane server's one replica is further capped at
five Prisma connections with a five-second acquisition timeout. That means a burst waits at PgBouncer
instead of holding every PostgreSQL connection while a run-admission transaction waits on a service
lock. If replica counts or database count change, change these numbers together and keep the summed
pooler budget below `postgresql.maxConnections`.

**Invariant.** One CNPG Cluster hosts many databases (not one cluster per authority — that wastes idle
pods and volumes). Because CNPG (as the database-pod controller) generates the instance-manager
`ServiceAccount` and its narrow `Role`/`RoleBinding` — deterministically named after the Cluster and
published in the `opencrane.ai/cnpg-service-account` annotation — this chart must **not** render a
competing `ServiceAccount`, `Role`, or `RoleBinding`. The database administrator must also remain a
distinct, non-superuser operational role with its own Secret; it must never collapse into an
application owner. The app owns the desired state and boundary; the vendor controller owns the
runtime identity it reconciles.

## What OpenCrane owns vs the vendor

| OpenCrane (this chart) | CloudNativePG (vendor) |
|---|---|
| Desired `Cluster` spec, logical databases, storage request, ingress isolation | Running Postgres pods, instance-manager identity, failover |
| Pinned PgBouncer image, pool size, client ingress, and pooler-to-instance egress | Reconciling the `Pooler` into its Deployment and Service |
| Supplying distinct application/admin Secret names, the app-owned target baseline reference, and database access | Bootstrapping the target SQL and reconciling roles/`Database` CRs |
| Selecting/enabling a backup plugin in values | Operator + CRD install (an external prerequisite) |

OpenCrane does **not** install or upgrade the CNPG operator, and does **not** generate, rotate, or
repair database credentials.

## Public surface

`Entrypoint:` the Helm chart under `helm/`. No importable code. Prerequisites the chart expects:

- a compatible CloudNativePG operator and CRDs, installed outside the OpenCrane release;
- access to the pinned `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/pgbouncer:1.25.1` Pooler image;
- one pre-created `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` Secret per logical database (`username`/`password`, where
  `username` equals that database's owner);
- one separate basic-auth Secret for the operational database administrator; its `username` must
  equal `databaseAdmin.name`, and both the username and Secret must differ from every application
  owner/Secret;
- one immutable target-baseline ConfigMap published from
  `apps/opencrane/prisma/bootstrap/target-baseline.sql` before a fresh install;
- the ConfigMap's full `opencrane.ai/baseline-sha256` identity supplied as
  `bootstrap.targetBaseline.sha256` for both fresh setup and physical recovery;
- a mounted `ReadWriteOnce` StorageClass with volume expansion enabled.

## Boundary

Storage only — it holds no application logic. It does not create shared roles, does not delete data on
uninstall, and does not manage the operator. Backup and restore stay disabled until a CNPG-I plugin and
its object-store resource are installed and explicitly selected in values.

## Dependency direction

An app entrypoint (Helm chart). It is composed by the silo umbrella chart
([`apps/_infra/deploy-k8s`](../_infra/deploy-k8s/README.md)) and imported by no package.

## Runtime & config

Install the database **before** the server release; grow the PVC request as durable data grows:

```bash
kubectl create namespace opencrane --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubernetes_api_host_cidr() {
  case "$1" in
    *:*) printf '%s/128' "$1" ;;
    *) printf '%s/32' "$1" ;;
  esac
}

  --namespace opencrane \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.opencrane\.ai/baseline-sha256}')"
KUBERNETES_API_SERVICE_IP="$(kubectl get service kubernetes --namespace default \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')"

  KUBERNETES_API_ENDPOINT_INDEX=$((KUBERNETES_API_ENDPOINT_INDEX + 1))
done < <(kubectl get endpoints kubernetes --namespace default \
  -o jsonpath='{range .subsets[*].addresses[*]}{.ip}{"\n"}{end}')

  --set databases[0].credentialsSecret=opencrane-postgres-bootstrap \
  --set databases[1].credentialsSecret=opencrane-obot-postgres-bootstrap \
  --set databases[2].credentialsSecret=opencrane-litellm-postgres-bootstrap
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready cluster/opencrane-postgres \
  --namespace opencrane --timeout=5m
```

The chart requires exactly one target baseline for `initdb` and renders no SQL reference on
`recovery`. Both paths require the full expected digest. A hook reads the protected marker restored
inside the application database and fails when it differs, so a caller cannot relabel an incompatible
backup as current. A changed baseline does not update a running Cluster: recreate an empty database
or restore a compatible physical backup. The k3d acceptance path server-dry-runs both contracts against the pinned CNPG CRDs, installs a pinned
Barman Cloud plugin and MinIO test target, writes a marker, completes an on-demand physical backup,
recovers a fresh Cluster, proves a false baseline claim is rejected, and verifies the data marker
through the recovered application Secret.

NetworkPolicy also requires the exact Kubernetes API Service and backing endpoint addresses. CNPG's
PgBouncer manager watches its `Pooler` and Secrets through that API; the two CIDR lists keep this
control path available whether the cluster enforces egress before or after Service translation. Use
`/128` rather than `/32` for IPv6, and list every API endpoint on a highly available control plane.
