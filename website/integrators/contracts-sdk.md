# Contracts SDK

`@opencrane/contracts` is the **public SDK and API contract** for the OpenCrane
control plane: a typed TypeScript client (`openapi-fetch`) plus DTOs generated
from the control-plane OpenAPI 3.1 specification
([`apps/control-plane/openapi.json`](https://github.com/opencrane/opencrane/blob/main/apps/control-plane/openapi.json)).

It is the same contract the `oc` CLI consumes — and the recommended way for any
external surface to talk to OpenCrane.

## Licensing — MIT, deliberately

The platform is AGPL-3.0-or-later, but **`@opencrane/contracts` is MIT**. This is
an intentional relicensing by the copyright owner so external consumers —
**including proprietary frontends** — can use the generated client and types
without inheriting AGPL obligations. The MIT grant covers only the
`libs/contracts/` directory.

## Consuming the contract externally

You don't need to import the package to build a client. The control plane
publishes its OpenAPI spec two ways:

- **At runtime:** `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`
- **As a release asset** named `openapi.json` on each tagged release.

External frontends should **pin a released `openapi.json`** and generate their own
client. This keeps a clean process/network boundary and links against no AGPL
code:

```bash
# Pin a specific OpenCrane release, then generate a typed client locally.
curl -fsSL -o openapi/opencrane.json \
  https://github.com/opencrane/opencrane/releases/download/<tag>/openapi.json
pnpm exec openapi-typescript openapi/opencrane.json -o src/api/generated.ts
```

## The spec is the source of truth

The OpenAPI spec is emitted at build time and guarded by a **CI drift gate**, so
the SDK, the CLI, and the [interactive API reference](/reference/api) on this site
never drift from the implementation.
