 * Build the tenant ConfigMap that carries both OpenClaw runtime configuration

 *
 * The generated ConfigMap serves three purposes:
 * - `openclaw.json` provides the effective OpenClaw gateway/runtime config
 *   after OpenCrane defaults are merged with any tenant overrides.
 * - `opencrane-managed-runtime.json` gives the tenant runtime an explicit
 *   description of the platform context it is running under.
 * - Workspace files (`AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SOUL.md.seed`, etc.) are
 *   seeded into the OpenClaw agent workspace by `entrypoint.sh` on boot.
 *   L0 files (no `.seed` suffix) are re-stamped on every boot; L2 files
 *   (`.seed` suffix) are copied once and then tenant-owned.
 *
 * @param config - Operator runtime configuration.
 * @param tenant - The Tenant CR being reconciled.
 * @param namespace - Namespace the ConfigMap is written to.
 * @param effectivePolicy - The resolved AccessPolicy, when one applies.
 * @param modelSet - The tenant's allowed model set fetched best-effort from the
 *        control-plane, or `null`. When LiteLLM is enabled the `litellm-proxy` provider runs in
 *        `replace` mode (it is the ONLY provider), restricted to these models with the default
 *        surfaced. An empty/null result yields `models: []` — and because there are no built-in
 *        providers to fall back to, the pod then has zero usable models. Cluster onboarding makes
 *        that impossible by requiring ≥1 registered model before a silo is provisioned; a transient
 *        control-plane outage at reconcile is the only window it can occur, and it self-heals on the
 *        next successful fetch.
 * @param servingHost - The host the org's Control UI is served at (`<org>.<base>` or
 *        vanity), used to allowlist the browser Origin in `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins`.
 *        With `bind: lan` the gateway rejects a Control-UI WS whose Origin is not allowlisted
 *        (`CONTROL_UI_ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED`); the SPA reaches the gateway via this host, so its
 *        `https://<host>` origin must be allowed. Omitted ⇒ no origin is added (the gateway's
 *        own localhost seeding applies — the pre-same-origin behaviour).

  //     "string" || typeof value.meta.lastTouchedAt === "string")` — NOT presence-only. A bare
  //     `{}` satisfies `isRecord` but neither string clause, so `hasConfigMeta$1` still returns
  //     false and `resolveConfigObserveSuspiciousReasons` still flags `missing-meta-vs-last-good`
  //     against the meta-stamped write `openclaw plugins install` leaves as "last known good" —

  //     `.bak` and rebooted with the stale pre-#168 plugin set. Re-verified this time against
  //     BOTH the downloaded openclaw@2026.6.11 tarball AND the literal installed binary inside
  //     the live pod (`/data/openclaw/runtime/node_modules/openclaw/dist/io-9CAVAPVZ.js`) before
  //     writing this fix — not inferred from a commit message.

 * Deterministic SHA-256 over a ConfigMap's `data` block, for the pod-template
 * `opencrane.io/config-checksum` annotation (see `_BuildDeployment`).
 *
 * WHY: OpenClaw reads `openclaw.json` only at process START. A mounted ConfigMap
 * update (e.g. a newly-registered BYOK default model landing in the `models`
 * block) refreshes the file on disk but does NOT restart the running process, so
 * a pod that booted before its models existed stays on the keyless
 * `gateway-injected` fallback forever. Stamping this digest on the pod template
 * makes any config change alter the template → the Recreate strategy rolls the
 * pod → OpenClaw re-reads the config and picks up the LiteLLM default model.
 *
 * Keys are sorted so the digest is stable across reconciles (no spurious rolls);
 * the values are the already-deterministic rendered config strings.
