/**
 * Build the per-silo baseline NetworkPolicy — the default-deny edge of a
 * ClusterTenant namespace (S2 / silo Phase 1, task_08734d58 + task_d6404452).
 *
 * An empty `podSelector` selects EVERY pod in the silo namespace, and naming both
 * `Ingress` and `Egress` in `policyTypes` flips the namespace to **default-deny**:
 * anything not explicitly allowed below is dropped. The allow-list is the minimum a
 * silo needs to function while staying isolated from every OTHER silo (east-west
 * default-deny — no silo→silo path exists because no rule names another silo):
 *
 * - **Ingress** from the same silo namespace (intra-silo) and from the
 *   opencrane-ui/operator namespace (the super-admin plane is the only principal
 *   allowed to reach in — it brokers the gateway connection).
 * - **Egress** to cluster DNS, and to the same silo namespace + the opencrane-ui
 *   namespace (the shared planes — opencrane-ui, Obot/MCP, feat-skill-registry, LiteLLM,
 *   Cognee — live there in the shared tier).
 *
 * External HTTPS (LLM/MCP/Git) is deliberately NOT in this policy — see
 * {@link _BuildSiloExternalEgressNetworkPolicy}, a separate policy so Cognee can be
 * excluded from it (an unpatched Cognee vuln — topoteretes/cognee#3084 — lets ANY
 * authenticated Cognee user overwrite the process-wide LLM/embedding endpoint with no
 * admin check; unrestricted external egress would let that be pointed at an
 * attacker-controlled host to exfiltrate every tenant's data flowing through this
 * silo's shared Cognee instance). NetworkPolicy is purely additive — a workload
 * covered by this baseline's intra-silo/DNS rules can still be excluded from a
 * DIFFERENT policy's broader grant, but the reverse (one policy narrowing what
 * another already allows) is not expressible in one resource, hence the split.
 *
 * This replaces the old single `opencrane-tenant-default` policy that sat in the
 * install namespace and (mis)selected tenant pods cluster-wide; the operator now
 * emits one correctly-scoped policy per silo namespace it provisions. The companions
 * {@link _BuildGatewayNetworkPolicy} and {@link _BuildSiloExternalEgressNetworkPolicy}
 * narrow/extend on top of this baseline (NetworkPolicy rules are additive, so all
 * three compose).
 *
 * NOTE: this is an L3/L4 namespace-scoped floor — the identity-based (SPIFFE/Cilium)
 * enforcement of the silo model lands later (S5). It only takes effect on a
 * NetworkPolicy-enforcing CNI; GKE Autopilot/Dataplane V2 enforces it inherently.
 *
 * @param namespace - The silo (ClusterTenant) namespace the policy is created in.
 * @param clusterTenantName - Parent ClusterTenant name, recorded as a label.
 * @param config - Operator config; supplies the opencrane-ui/operator namespace.
 * @returns The default-deny baseline NetworkPolicy for the silo namespace.
