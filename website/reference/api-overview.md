# API overview

The OpenCrane control plane exposes a versioned HTTP API at `/api/v1`.

::: tip Looking for the endpoint list?
This page covers authentication, error envelopes, and pagination conventions. For
the full, browsable endpoint and schema reference, see the
[interactive API reference](/reference/api).
:::

A machine-readable OpenAPI 3.1 description is emitted from the build and served at runtime:

```
GET /api/v1/openapi.json
```

Use the OpenAPI document as the authoritative contract. This reference provides a human-readable overview and authentication guide.

---

## Authentication

All endpoints (except the auth and OpenAPI routes listed below) require a bearer token.

**Header format:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Current paths:**
- **Bearer token** — set `OPENCRANE_TOKEN` or pass `--token` to the CLI. This is the automation and break-glass path.
- **OIDC** — human operators authenticate via `GET /api/v1/auth/login` → callback → session cookie. See the [Auth](#auth) section below.

Projected ServiceAccount tokens are the current in-cluster authentication mechanism for pod-to-control-plane calls. Each tenant pod presents an audience-bound projected token that is validated via the Kubernetes TokenReview API (`/api/internal/contract`, `/api/internal/awareness/participation`). Static bearer tokens remain the automation and break-glass path for operators outside the cluster.

---

## Base URL

All API routes are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Infrastructure routes (`/healthz`, `/prom`) are unprefixed.

:::: details How the effective model is resolved
At call time the control plane walks this precedence and writes the winner into the
tenant's effective contract — no pod restart:

```
explicit request override
  → skill-pinned model
    → skill auto-config
      → ClusterTenant default
        → Global default
```

Each tenant's LiteLLM virtual key carries a `models[]` allowlist, populated from the
registry at key-mint time and kept in sync by the operator's reconcile loop. A call to
a model outside the allowlist is rejected at the gateway.

**How measurement estimates savings.** A run replays every eval case through both the
baseline and the candidate model, grades each output with an independent judge model,
reads the real per-call USD cost from LiteLLM, and estimates the saving with a
bootstrap 95% confidence interval. A proposal is emitted only when that interval
excludes zero.

The measurement seams are **live** — they require a deployed LiteLLM, provider keys,
and a `ROUTING_JUDGE_MODEL`. With any unset, a run is a safe no-op. Full operator
recipe: [`docs/operators/routing-measurement.md`](https://github.com/italanta/opencrane/blob/main/docs/operators/routing-measurement.md).

::: warning Trust the judge, but verify it
Keep the judge model independent of the candidate's family — a model graded by a
sibling of itself scores too highly. LLM-as-judge grading also carries position and
verbosity bias, so calibrate against a small human-graded slice before trusting the
absolute savings figure.

## Error Envelopes

All `4xx` and `5xx` responses return a consistent envelope:

```json
{

```

Common codes: `TENANT_NOT_FOUND`, `POLICY_NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `UPSTREAM_ERROR`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `DATASET_DENIED`, `UNAUTHORIZED`.

---

## Pagination

Endpoints that return collections use cursor-based keyset pagination:

```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 100,
    "hasMore": true,
    "nextCursor": "eyJ..."
  }
}
```

Pass `?cursor=<nextCursor>` to fetch the next page.
