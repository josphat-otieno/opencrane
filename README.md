# OpenCrane Platform

## The Vision: AI Skills for Every Employee

AI agent skills are transforming how organizations build AI workflows. Tools like [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and Hermes are creating a new experience: a **personal AI assistant for every employee**. They learn your work patterns, integrate with your tools, and automate your most repetitive tasks—without requiring you to write a single line of code.

At the individual level, these tools work beautifully. One person, one assistant, endless possibilities.

**But what happens when you scale?** How do you give every member of your organization their own intelligent assistant? How do you share skills across teams? How do you manage context across different employees/projects/departments, and extend the agentic loop's context search with this information? How do you share context from the individual to the team? How do you keep them secure, compliant, and up-to-date? How do you prevent chaos?

## Why OpenCrane? The Risk of Vendor-Hosted Solutions

Existing vendor-hosted AI platforms (like Claude Cowork and OpenAI's emerging skills solutions) offer convenience, but at a hidden cost: **existential risk**. Here's why self-hosting your AI organization matters:

**The Problem with Vendor-Hosted Skills:**
- **Vendor becomes your competitor**: When you build and host skills on any vendor platform, that vendor learns your workflows, best practices, and domain expertise. They can commercialize this knowledge or offer it to your competitors.
- **Loss of competitive advantage**: Your proprietary skills—the institutional knowledge that differentiates you—are indexed, analyzed, and potentially shared or monetized by the host.
- **Pricing lock-in**: Vendors can unilaterally change pricing, restrict features, or discontinue services. You have no fallback; your skills are stuck in their ecosystem.
- **Data governance nightmare**: Personal conversations between employees and AI are potentially visible to the vendor. Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) becomes uncertain when your data lives in someone else's infrastructure.
- **Model switching trap**: Build your skills on Claude today, need GPT-4 tomorrow? Your skills are tightly coupled to the vendor's platform. Migration is painful or impossible.

**Why Self-Hosting Matters:**
- **You own your skills**: Proprietary workflows and knowledge stay in your control, not monetized by vendors.
- **Competitive moat**: Build institutional knowledge that's unique to your organization, unavailable to competitors.
- **True data sovereignty**: Employee conversations, company context, and organizational intelligence stay on your infrastructure—never shared with third parties.
- **Model independence**: Switch between Claude, GPT-4, open-source models, or your own without losing your skills investment.
- **Regulatory compliance**: Full audit trails, RBAC, encryption, and data residency under your control.

**The Difference:**
| Aspect | Vendor-Hosted Solutions | Self-Hosted (OpenCrane) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Skill ownership** | Vendor hosts & can analyze your skills | You own everything |
| **Competitive risk** | Vendor learns your workflows | Your workflows stay private |
| **Model switching** | Locked to vendor's LLM | Use any LLM provider |
| **Data residency** | Vendor's servers | Your infrastructure |
| **Regulatory control** | Vendor's terms; compliance uncertain | Full compliance under your control |
| **Pricing** | Vendor can change at will | You control infrastructure costs |

OpenCrane solves this by giving organizations a **self-hosted control plane** where personal assistants, shared skills, and organizational knowledge stay completely under your control—while still providing the convenience and scale of a cloud-native platform.

### Meet OpenCrane

OpenCrane is a **control plane for organizational AI**. It sits on top of agent frameworks and gives organizations the power to issue personal assistants to every employee while maintaining complete control over security, governance, organizational knowledge, and information access.

**Your organization stays in control:**
- **Personal assistants at scale**: Deploy a private AI assistant for every employee in minutes—each one isolated, secure, and acting on behalf of that employee.
- **One dedicated silo per organisation**: Every customer org runs its own isolated stack—dedicated operator, control plane, LLM proxy, MCP gateway, knowledge base, skill registry, and database—provisioned and managed by a central fleet. There is no shared singleton that mixes org data.
- **Vendor independence and BYOK**: Choose your LLM provider—Claude, GPT, open-source models—without lock-in. Each org sets its own provider keys (Bring Your Own Key) through the platform API (with CLI coverage for day-to-day operations); keys are stored as Kubernetes Secrets and routed only through the org's LiteLLM proxy, never written to the database.
- **Model routing and cost control**: Pin a model per skill or let the platform choose. The platform sets per-employee budgets and model allowlists, which the org's LiteLLM proxy enforces at request time; the control plane meters spend and warns as budgets approach. An eval-driven, human-gated optimisation loop surfaces "switch this skill's model to save N% at equal quality".
- **Self-hosted, data-sovereign**: Deploy OpenCrane on your infrastructure. Your organizational data—documents, conversations, collected information—stays on your network, never sent to external vendors. Shared skills are stored and versioned in your repository.
- **Security and governance**: Identity-keyed network isolation (Cilium + SPIFFE) gives every workload a cryptographic identity; each silo is default-deny. One fleet release manages identity, access control, skill deployment, cost tracking, audit, and RBAC-filtered access to organizational knowledge across all silos.
- **Organizational intelligence**: Company-wide information gathering agents harvest knowledge from your platforms—starting with Slack, with further sources connecting through the MCP gateway as they land—and make it available to assistants through retrieval plugins, with automatic role-based filtering.
- **Scale from day one**: From 10 employees to 10,000—the same Kubernetes-native architecture scales seamlessly.

## How It Works

Each employee gets their own **private AI assistant**—an isolated OpenClaw instance running as a Kubernetes pod. This assistant:

- **Knows who you are**: Holds your personal access tokens and can read and write data across the organization's platforms *as you*
- **Stays private**: Your conversations with the AI are stored locally in your pod's encrypted storage. OpenCrane enforces network-level policies and budget controls, but does not log or inspect conversation contents.
- **Accesses organizational knowledge directly**: Queries Cognee from the OpenClaw/Clawdbot runtime during the agentic loop, with policy-compatible dataset scope selection and citations.

OpenCrane also runs **company-wide information gathering agents** (dedicated tenant deployments with elevated permissions) that:
- Continuously harvest organizational knowledge, starting with Slack, with further sources (Teams, email, ticketing systems) connecting through the MCP gateway as they land
- Index this knowledge into a centralized Org Knowledge Index
- Make it available to all tenant assistants via retrieval plugins (role-based access)

OpenCrane orchestrates all of this by:
- **Infrastructure Management**: Deploying and managing assistants for each employee. Supporting local or remote LLM models. Setting token budgets and cost limits per employee, enforced by the org's LLM proxy and metered by the control plane.
- **Permissions Control Plane**: Managing dataset memberships and permissions in Cognee (for org/team/project/personal scopes) without sitting in the retrieval request path.
- **Uniform Awareness Runtime**: Enforcing a common awareness contract across tenant runtimes (query rewrite rules, scope selection, citations, fallback, freshness behavior).
- **Organizational Knowledge**: Company-wide agents harvest and index org data; direct tenant retrieval runtimes make it accessible based on role and dataset scope.
- **Scalable architecture**: The same multi-tenant, Kubernetes-native design works from 10 to 10,000 employees.
- **Skill sharing**: Managing skill updates and deployments across the organization.
- **Secure storage**: All data stored in your organization's infrastructure, encrypted at rest.

## Architecture

OpenCrane is **Kubernetes-native** and **API-first**. A central **fleet** manages
organisation lifecycle (ClusterTenant provisioning, CRDs, platform DNS, and identity
brokering). Each customer organisation runs its own **silo**: a dedicated operator,
opencrane-api, LiteLLM proxy, MCP gateway (Obot), knowledge base (Cognee), skill
registry, and database — all in an isolated namespace, with no shared data between orgs.

Within each silo:

- every employee gets **one isolated OpenClaw pod**, with its own encrypted storage;
- the silo's planes — LLM routing, MCP tools, and organizational knowledge — are
  accessed only with short-lived, scoped credentials; and
- the org host (`acme.opencrane.ai`) routes each signed-in user to their own pod
  internally — there are no per-user public subdomains.

The super-admin is the only identity that can reach across silos. Conversations stay
inside the pod — OpenCrane governs access, budgets, and networking, but never inspects
them.

A single **ClusterTenant** (one organisation, no fleet) — the manager is the whole control plane, and each employee gets an isolated pod that reaches tools through one Obot MCP gateway:

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node 22+
- Kubernetes 1.28+ (GKE recommended)
- Helm 3
- Terraform 1.5+ (for GCP deployment)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (Cloud SQL or local)

### Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run test
```

### Local Deployment

The deploy scripts can provision the cluster too — `--provision local|gke|vps` creates and targets a cluster before installing (otherwise they deploy onto the current kubectl context).

```bash
# One command: provision a local k3d cluster AND install the fleet onto it.
# The fleet-platform chart's deploy.sh now lives in the WeOwnAI repo (italanta/opencrane#150) —
# check that out first, e.g.: ../weownai/apps/fleet-platform/deploy.sh --provision local --base-domain opencrane.local

# Add an organisation (silo) once the fleet is up:
apps/opencrane-infra/deploy.sh --cluster-tenant acme --base-domain opencrane.local
```

For fast dev iteration with locally-built images, the `libs/k8s-platform/tests/k3d-local.sh` harness (k3d + local images; `LOCAL_PROFILE=strict` for prod-style Helm validation) remains available. The `strict` profile does not emulate GCP-only capabilities (Workload Identity, GCS, External Secrets, GCE ingress, Cloud DNS) — it validates the same core wiring with stricter chart inputs locally.

### GCP Deployment

```bash
# One command: provision a GKE cluster (Terraform, internally) AND install the fleet.
# The fleet-platform chart's deploy.sh now lives in the WeOwnAI repo (italanta/opencrane#150) —
# check that out first, e.g.: ../weownai/apps/fleet-platform/deploy.sh --provision gke \
#   --project-id my-project --base-domain opencrane.ai

# Add a silo for an organisation (once per org)
apps/opencrane-infra/deploy.sh \
  --cluster-tenant acme --base-domain opencrane.ai

# Or provision + deploy the fleet AND one seeded org in a single pass (FLEET_CHART_DIR must
# point at a checked-out copy of WeOwnAI's apps/fleet-platform — see italanta/opencrane#150)
FLEET_CHART_DIR=../weownai/apps/fleet-platform \
libs/k8s-platform/deploy-single-tenant.sh --provision gke \
  --project-id my-project --base-domain opencrane.ai \
  --org-name acme --org-owner-email owner@acme.example

# Prefer to manage infra yourself? Provision with Terraform
# (libs/k8s-platform/terraform/environments/dev) and run the deploy scripts WITHOUT
# --provision against the resulting cluster.

# 3. Create a tenant via the oc CLI
export OPENCRANE_URL=https://opencrane.ai
export OPENCRANE_TOKEN=<your-access-token>

oc tenants create \
  --name jente \
  --display-name "Jente" \
  --email jente@example.com

# Or via CRD directly
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: opencrane.io/v1alpha1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: jente
spec:
  displayName: Jente
  email: jente@example.com
EOF
```

The operator provisions everything the tenant needs — storage, identity, an encryption key, and access through the org's ingress. Employees sign in at the org host (e.g. `https://acme.opencrane.ai`); the platform routes each session to their own pod internally. See [Set up your domain](https://opencrane.ai/guide/dns) for DNS and TLS.

### CLI Quick Reference

Every administrative capability is reachable through `oc`, the platform CLI:

```bash
export OPENCRANE_URL=https://opencrane.ai
export OPENCRANE_TOKEN=<your-access-token>

oc tenants list              # list all employee assistants
oc tenants suspend jente     # scale one to zero
oc budget spend jente        # current spend for a tenant
oc audit list --tenant jente # query the audit log
```

See the [CLI reference](https://opencrane.ai/reference/cli) for the full command list and the [API reference](https://opencrane.ai/reference/api) for the HTTP API.

### Version Pinning

Pin a tenant to a specific OpenClaw version:

```yaml
apiVersion: opencrane.io/v1alpha1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: jente
spec:
  displayName: Jente
  email: jente@example.com
  openclawVersion: "2026.3.15"
```

Without `openclawVersion`, tenants install `latest` on first boot and can self-update via `openclaw update`.
