# OpenCrane UI design target

[`opencrane-frontend-wireframes.html`](./opencrane-frontend-wireframes.html) is the canonical visual
context target for the current frontend plan. The repository copy was imported from
`opencrane-frontend-wireframes-4.html` and has SHA-256
`b695783c1e3e7c07ba5712c86af03bc39855078d089bc9c7c4f32d4c0dc51f3c`.

[`opencrane-conversation-state-supplement.html`](./opencrane-conversation-state-supplement.html)
is the finite-state supplement to that accepted v4 export. It preserves v4's workspace and
paper/origami language while resolving the edge cases that v4 deliberately left in its “Try next”
notes. The supplement takes precedence only for the finite-state and protocol corrections enumerated
below; v4 remains authoritative for workspace composition and visual language.

The wireframe is product and component context, not evidence that a route, authority, or journey is
implemented or fully specified. Code, Storybook states, Playwright journeys, deployment, and live
qualification remain separate exit gates in [`plan.md`](../../plan.md).

## Conversation workspace scope

- Boards `8a` through `8j` define the workspace shell, onboarding history, streaming and reconnect,
  attachments, durable assets, tool activity, elicitation, A2UI, Files, and Activity.
- Boards `9a` and `9b` define the proposed A2UI component catalogue and progressive render.
- Boards `10a` through `10g` define group `@agent` admission, the complete parent-summary state
  machine, the breadcrumb Agent-thread workspace, immediate-parent delivery, serial follow-up runs,
  compact navigation, routes, and authority boundaries. Some access and recovery cases are stated
  as text rather than shown as dedicated boards.

## Resolved finite-state contract

Supplement boards `11a` through `11f` close the v4 design gaps without changing its primary
workspace composition:

- `11a` renders queued Agent-thread admission, active reconnect, direct ask-card deep links, the
  revoked-client transition, and the indistinguishable unavailable route. Revocation purges rendered
  child content, drafts, cursors, filenames, run details, and ask text; missing, foreign, guessed,
  and never-authorized child ids reveal neither conversation kind nor prior access.
- `11b` renders scanning, inaccessible, expired, removed, and foreign asset states. Local selections
  are removable before admission; after admission the server must return a removal capability.
- `11c` makes free text visibly bounded, separates local selection from authoritative submission,
  and restores focus to the original ask after step-up authentication.
- `11d` retains the in-process A2UI sink but re-pins it directly to supported upstream A2UI packages,
  removing OpenClaw lockstep. The catalogue contains eleven admitted components, uses upstream
  `surfaceUpdate` and `dataModelUpdate` vocabulary, and returns actions only through server authority.
- `11e` projects parent summaries from orthogonal run, conversation, access, recovery, and admission
  dimensions. Canonical routes use immutable conversation ids; display slugs remain labels only.
- `11f` provides compact equivalents. All states use the production tokenized 3px focus ring and
  retain keyboard, announcement, and reduced-motion semantics.

The component-manager gate passed against the live catalogue on 2026-08-10. The accepted v4
screenshots remain the primary issue evidence;
`conversation-state-supplement.png` is the stable edge-state extract until production Storybook owns
deterministic component screenshots.
