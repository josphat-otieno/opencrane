 * Per-IP request rate limiter shared by both managers' API servers. Mounted once, early, in each
 * app's middleware chain (before the routes) so every authz-gated / DB-backed endpoint is covered
 * — a DoS backstop that also satisfies the `js/missing-rate-limiting` scanning rule.
 *
 * The default cap is deliberately generous (1000/min/IP): real opencrane-ui traffic stays well
 * under it, so this never shapes normal use — it only sheds a flood. Health probes (`/healthz`,
 * `/readyz`) and the high-frequency trusted internal pod-poll surface (`/api/internal/*`) are
 * exempt so liveness checks and operator loops are never throttled.
 *
 * @param opts - Optional window/max overrides.
 * @returns An Express middleware enforcing the per-IP limit.
