# Governed skill runtime support

> [backend](../../README.md) › [agents](../README.md) › skills

| Package | What it owns |
|---|---|
| [controller](./controller/README.md) | The outbound reconciliation that turns a fenced workload claim into an exact still-suspended Job. |
| [execution](./execution/main/README.md) | One short-lived Postgres unit of work for claim, assignment, release, bootstrap, and authoring-worker fences. |
| [k8s-launcher](./k8s-launcher/README.md) | Pure, policy-validating Kubernetes Job shapes for isolated skill authoring and tool execution. |
| [worker](./worker/README.md) | The fail-closed Python acknowledgement client for the governed worker-image build. |

The server-side skills package provides browser-safe catalogue discovery; this area contains the
runtime support that turns already-authorized work into isolated workloads. It never stores skill
bytes, talks to a registry, or grants Kubernetes API access to a worker.
