# @opencrane/core — frontend domain foundation

> [frontend](../README.md) › core

## What it owns

This is the frontend **core** package: the base layer every other frontend package sits on. It
holds the cross-cutting primitives the SPA (the single-page app, `apps/opencrane-ui`) shares — the
domain models, the typed API client, the theme, and pure utilities — so no feature has to redefine
them or hand-roll HTTP.

It is the bottom of the frontend dependency graph: it depends on no other `@opencrane` frontend
package, and everything else may depend on it. Its most load-bearing job is being the **one door to
the server**: all HTTP goes through the API services here, typed against the generated contract, so
a feature never calls `fetch` directly and never guesses a request or response shape.

```
 features · elements · state  ──import──►  core  ──types against──►  @opencrane/contracts
                                            │
                                            └─ ControlPlaneApiService  ──HTTP──►  opencrane-server
```

**In this flow:** `@opencrane/contracts` *(the generated typed client shared with the backend)*

## Public surface

- `lib/models/*.types.ts` — shared data models (DTOs), enums, and colour/label maps (`scope`, `session`, `thread`,
  `context`, `notification`, `settings`, `mcp`, `plan`).
- `lib/data/*.data.ts` — demo fixtures, temporary until the live API replaces them.
- `ControlPlaneApiService` — the typed HTTP client and its `CONTROL_PLANE_BASE_URL` injection token.
- `OpenCraneApiError` — the browser-safe failed-request model. It preserves the public status/code
  and bounded validation issues so forms can bind `issue.path` to controls, while discarding
  server-only detail and arbitrary response bodies.
- `WeOwnAiPreset` (`lib/theme/weownai-preset`) — the PrimeNG (the component library) theme preset.
- `lib/utils/*` — framework-agnostic helpers (`_ToggleId`, collection helpers).

## Boundary

Consumed by every other frontend package. The control-plane client types against
`@opencrane/contracts`, generated from the backend's OpenAPI spec so the browser and server use the
same contract. It must never import backend application source — the network contract is the only
coupling.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `type:lib`, `layer:frontend`, and `scope:web` (the frontend dependency tier): it may import
only other `scope:web` packages and `scope:shared` contracts. It imports no other frontend package;
its one dependency is the `scope:shared` `@opencrane/contracts`.
