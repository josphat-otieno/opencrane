# App-Specific Guidance

> Part of the OpenCrane agent guidance. See [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for the index.

This is the per-package map. The general TypeScript rules ([`typescript.md`](./typescript.md)) and
identity rules ([`architecture.md`](./architecture.md), [`k8s.md`](./k8s.md)) apply to all of them.
Build/test a single package with `pnpm --filter <name> build|test`. **Each package has a deep-dive doc
linked below** — read it before non-trivial work in that package. The whole-cluster picture is in
[`cluster-architecture.md`](./cluster-architecture.md).

## Apps (`apps/`)

| Package | Deep-dive | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `@opencrane/fleet-operator` | [apps/fleet-operator.md](./apps/fleet-operator.md) | K8s operator — resilient watch loops reconciling Tenant/ClusterTenant/AccessPolicy CRs into namespaces, pods, NetworkPolicies, storage. Pluggable hosting adapters (GCP/on-prem). |
| `@opencrane/clustertenant-operator` | [apps/clustertenant-operator.md](./apps/clustertenant-operator.md) | API-first hub (**Express 5** + Prisma + K8s client). Source of truth for tenants/grants/MCP/skills; OIDC broker; dual-writes CRDs ↔ Postgres. Listens `:8080`. |
| `@opencrane/cli` | [apps/cli.md](./apps/cli.md) | The `oc` CLI — a **thin typed wrapper** over the contracts client, no business logic. OIDC device-flow login; `--output table|json`. |
| `@opencrane/skill-registry` | [apps/skill-registry.md](./apps/skill-registry.md) | Entitlement-gated skill delivery (`:5000`). TokenReview (`aud=skill-registry`) → proxy to control-plane; non-entitled **and** non-existent → `404` (existence-hiding). |
| `@opencrane/harvesting-agent` | [apps/harvesting-agent.md](./apps/harvesting-agent.md) | Background ingestion worker (not API-first). Slack → normalise → Cognee; cursor in Postgres. `/healthz`, `/metrics`. |
| _(apps/tenant)_ | — | Tenant-side assets / templates (not a workspace package). |

## Libs (`libs/`)

| Package | Deep-dive | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `@opencrane/contracts` | [libs/contracts.md](./libs/contracts.md) | **The keystone** — shared CRD enums/DTOs + the generated typed control-plane client (`___CreateControlPlaneClient`, `paths`). Import from the barrel; never redefine types per app. |
| `@opencrane/awareness` | [libs/awareness.md](./libs/awareness.md) | In-pod SDK to query org context (Cognee) directly. Enforces citations + contract-version stamping; golden-suite gates the rollout. |
| _(libs/onboarding)_ | — | **Empty placeholder** — not in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, no code yet. |

## API-First / CLI-First Rule

Every control-plane capability must be **API-first** and expose a matching `oc` CLI command in
`apps/cli`. No control-plane behaviour should be reachable only through a frontend — a UI is just
another client of the management API, never a privileged path.

## Nested AGENTS.md

Some subdirectories carry their own `AGENTS.md` (e.g. tenant workspace templates under
`apps/fleet-operator/src/tenants/deploy/workspace/`). Those are scoped to that directory's generated
artifacts and do not override this guidance for platform source.
