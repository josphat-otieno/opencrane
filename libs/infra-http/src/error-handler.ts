/**
 * Express 5 global error handler shared by both the fleet-manager and the silo control plane.
 * Catches any error thrown from (or passed to `next()` by) a route handler — including the
 * authz gates' `.catch(next)` — and STRUCTURED-LOGS it before formatting the standard error
 * envelope. Register AFTER all routes so Express selects it only for errors.
 *
 * `detail` carries the raw error message in DEVELOPMENT only and is STRIPPED in production
 * (`NODE_ENV=production`) so Prisma messages, stack traces, and ORM internals never reach a
 * client there. Callers MUST always branch on `code`, never on a human message or `detail`.
 *
 * An unmapped Prisma unique-constraint violation (P2002) is a client conflict, not a server
 * error — return a clean 409 (no detail, any env) so the ORM message can never leak through
 * the generic 500 path. Routes SHOULD still catch P2002 themselves for a domain-specific
 * message (e.g. POST /cluster-tenants → "workspace name").
 *
 * @param log - Pino logger instance.
