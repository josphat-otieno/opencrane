# @opencrane/backend/agents/execution/protocol — runtime protocol authority

## What it owns

This package is the checkpoint between OpenCrane and the process that executes a personal or managed
agent. The executor may be implemented in any language; it receives commands and proposes results,
but it does not get to decide what is current or authoritative. This package owns that decision
through the language-neutral `AgentRuntimeProtocol v1`.

Before a command reaches an executor, it checks that the command belongs to the currently assigned
run attempt, carries the exact frozen input snapshot and tagged user-or-service identity, arrives in
order, and is still inside its lease. A service principal cannot be interpreted as a user merely
because both carry signed fleet-membership evidence.

When the executor proposes an event or outside action, it performs the mirror check before another
domain may persist or execute that proposal.

This package owns both that pure decision and the Prisma-backed adapter that drives it. The adapter
loads and locks the live workload assignment for a connected runtime Pod, mints only the command the
pure authority accepts, and durably advances the monotonic command sequence and the accepted
candidate ids so a transport reconnect can neither reorder nor duplicate work. Its compiler adapter
hydrates the immutable snapshot through the same locked Prisma transaction before dispatch.
For the two workload-reportable terminal results, the app injects the canonical run authority into
that transaction: `run.completed` and `run.failed` become one durable run outcome, stream event, and
child-to-parent notification. A runtime cannot cancel itself; cancellation remains server-owned.
The package-private candidate-side-effect adapter keeps those terminal writes and digest-only
`tool.completed` receipts inside the already-admitted transaction; it never advances the stream or
dispatches provider I/O.

```

**In this flow:** [execution/runs](../runs/main/README.md) · [conversation replay](../../../server/agents/conversation-replay/main/README.md)

Invariant: an executor can only propose a result for a command OpenCrane already accepted for the
exact current attempt and lease. The `cancelling` run state closes command, event-candidate, and
external-action admission immediately through the same `terminal_run` denial used by completed,
failed, and cancelled runs; it is not a second runtime authority. Duplicate command or candidate
identifiers are idempotent; stale, expired, out-of-order, malformed, or mismatched frames are denied
with a stable reason.

An admitted external action can be replayed only before its runner creates a durable invocation
receipt. That narrow failure returns an explicit bounded retry result from a server-owned per-candidate
budget and deadline, so a reconnecting runtime cannot reset it. The runtime resubmits the same
candidate identifier rather than falsely treating the action as accepted or emitting a terminal
executor error. Once a runner records a durable refusal or result, that outcome is final and remains
fail closed. If a frozen integration later becomes inactive, revoked, expired, or absent, the
invocation receipt retains that bounded authority reason and the action boundary emits a
credential-free structured event; it never collapses a policy revocation into a transport failure.

It intentionally owns no HTTP listener, Kubernetes resource, model driver, or provider credential.
Its production factory composes the external-action runner from the durable invocation, personal
configuration, integration, approval, clock, and fail-closed transport adapters. The runner selects
the user-only personal upgrade tool before reserving it; every other action is reserved before its
transport can run, and a deferred approval is bound to that exact reservation. The app supplies only
process persistence, fixed policy values, and logging, then hands the resulting authority to the
stream transport. An integration action has the fixed
`integration:<integrationId>:<toolName>` shape: its live custody reference and revision allow-list
are rechecked at execution, so the runtime never sees either credential or mutable permission state.

## Public surface

- `__CreateProductionRuntimeDispatchAuthority` — constructs the ready production authority,
  including first-party personal-session tool augmentation, external-action routing, frozen memory
  dataset selection, deferred approval recovery, retry bounds, and canonical terminal reporting.
- `_CreateSteeringIngestRouter` — the ready-to-mount Prisma composition that maps the shared
  authenticated request principal into the steering caller and supplies the queue and clock.
- `_RuntimeSteeringOpenapiPaths` — contributes the steering contract to the server-owned API spec.

Pure protocol decisions, Prisma adapters, executor construction, and their supporting types remain
inside this package. The production external-action runner and its composition helpers are
package-private seams for the factory, not alternate entrypoints for sibling domains.

## Boundary

The runtime opens its authenticated stream outward to OpenCrane. This library makes stale,
replayed, expired, mismatched, cancelling, and terminal frames fail closed. It owns admission only;
cancellation and durable events remain with their canonical authorities.

## Data & persistence

The compiler adapter reads the immutable persona, conversation, artifact, skill, and model-route
records needed to compile a dispatch, and turns the snapshot's integration assignments directly
into approval-required tool descriptors. The dispatch adapter owns two Postgres models in
`runtime.prisma`: `RuntimeCommandStream` (one per run
attempt — the lease fence, the bound runtime instance, the next command sequence, and accepted
candidate ids) and `RuntimeDispatchedCommand` (one row per minted command, whose ids are exactly the
attempt's accepted command set). Their clean-database schema lives in the OpenCrane-owned target
baseline. It reads the assignment, run, and immutable snapshot rows owned by the execution-run and
conversation domains. Terminal state remains written by the injected execution-run authority, never
by this transport/protocol package directly.

`RuntimeSteeringRequest` holds each owner-authored instruction before the runtime observes it. A
request can be accepted only before the attempt's single fenced resume command is minted; that command
consumes every pending request and seeds the runtime's pre-model buffer. This prevents a second
executor loop from running concurrently for the same attempt. Its queue is deliberately separate from
`RuntimeSteeringBoundary`, which remains the sole authority that can advance input generation. A lost
browser connection therefore cannot drop an instruction or force a model turn to change mid-flight.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `scope:execution-protocol` (`layer:backend`): it may depend on agent, execution-run,
execution-input, and personal-configuration contracts, authentication, authorization, the
integration authority, the three injected transport-port scopes, and shared contracts. The
authentication edge resolves only the
backend-type-free request principal. The integration edge is read-only: it resolves and rechecks the revision's live
custody reference before the Obot invocation port executes an allowed tool. Its fail-closed
transport adapters implement those narrow ports without exposing credentials. The package never
imports an app or a model driver.

Personal and managed runtime Pods share the same protocol but not an identity plane: every tagged
snapshot is re-bound to its deployment-owned namespace, projected-token audience, and ServiceAccount
grammar before a command or candidate is accepted.
