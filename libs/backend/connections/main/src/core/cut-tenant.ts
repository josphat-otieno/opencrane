/**
 * Cut a tenant's brokered OpenClaw connections — the per-user kill-switch (CONN.5).
 *
 * Two layers, applied in order so a revoke is always recorded even if the
 * force-disconnect fails:
 *   1. **Gateway revoke (best-effort)** — ask the pod gateway to revoke device
 *      tokens + pairings so the cut connections cannot re-authenticate. The
 *      default admin is a no-op until a opencrane-ui operator device is paired
 *      (CONN.4), so this half may report `ok: false` — that is expected.
 *   2. **Registry revoke** — mark the BrokeredDevice rows revoked so the
 *      opencrane-ui's view of active connections is accurate.
 *   3. **Kubernetes force-disconnect** — on a *full-tenant* cut, delete the pod
 *      so every established WebSocket is severed immediately. This is
 *      CNI-independent (unlike a deny NetworkPolicy, which only helps if the CNI
 *      drops *established* flows) and is the authoritative cut. A *subject*-scoped
 *      self-serve cut does **not** delete the pod (that would sign out everyone on
 *      the shared per-tenant pod); it relies on the gateway's per-device revoke.
 *
 * @param coreApi      - Kubernetes Core V1 API client (pod deletion).
 * @param prisma       - Prisma client (BrokeredDevice registry).
 * @param gatewayAdmin - Gateway revoke client (live WS path or the no-op default).
 * @param params       - Tenant, namespace, optional subject scope, and reason.
 * @returns A summary of what was revoked and whether the pod was force-deleted.
