# artifact-preprocessor — isolated PDF text worker

> [apps](../README.md) › artifact-preprocessor

The artifact preprocessor is an outbound-only app that turns one authorised PDF into searchable plain
text. It has temporary scratch storage and a rotating Kubernetes ServiceAccount token, but no
database, ArtifactStore address, persistent volume, signing key, lease, or receipt.

## What it owns

The app validates its resource ceilings, creates the OpenCrane-only remote adapter and shell-free
Poppler converter, and runs an abortable polling loop. OpenCrane chooses the source revision, brokers
both byte directions, and decides whether the derived text may be published.

```
 OpenCrane server ........ claim + PDF stream
       │                          ▲ text stream / bounded failure
       ▼                          │
 ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ artifact-preprocessor  ◄── HERE                     │
 │ emptyDir only · projected token · pdftotext only   │
 └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Invariant: the worker can neither choose nor address an artifact. Every source, output, and failure
request is authenticated and fenced by the server-issued attempt. Local source and output files are
removed after success, failure, or cancellation.

## Public surface

`src/index.ts` is the sole entrypoint. It starts telemetry first, validates configuration, composes
the worker library, and drains the poll loop on `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` before flushing telemetry.
The app exposes no HTTP listener, Service, Ingress, or Kubernetes API permission.

## Boundary

The app may call only the same-silo OpenCrane internal listener. OpenCrane TokenReviews its projected
token for the exact ServiceAccount and audience before returning work or bytes. The worker never
calls artifact-service and never receives an ArtifactStore URL, content address, signed lease, or
promotion receipt.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `type:app`, `layer:entrypoint`, and `scope:artifacts`. This thin app composes the artifact
preprocessor library and shared observability; catalogue, persistence, byte storage, and publication
remain server-owned.

## Runtime & config

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENCRANE_INTERNAL_URL` | Same-silo OpenCrane broker origin | Helm-derived |
| `OPENCRANE_PREPROCESSOR_TOKEN_PATH` | Rotating projected token file | required |
| `ARTIFACT_PREPROCESSOR_SCRATCH_DIRECTORY` | Absolute bounded scratch path | required |
| `ARTIFACT_PREPROCESSOR_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Idle or handled-error delay | `1000` |
| `ARTIFACT_PREPROCESSOR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-request deadline | `10000` |
| `ARTIFACT_PREPROCESSOR_MAX_SOURCE_BYTES` | Maximum source PDF bytes | `33554432` |
| `ARTIFACT_PREPROCESSOR_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` | Maximum extracted text bytes | `16777216` |
| `ARTIFACT_PREPROCESSOR_CONVERSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | Maximum `pdftotext` duration | `30000` |

The container is built from `deploy/Dockerfile`, installs only Poppler in its runtime layer, runs as
an unprivileged user, and executes `dist/apps/artifact-preprocessor/index.js`.
