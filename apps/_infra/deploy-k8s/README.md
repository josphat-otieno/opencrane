# deploy-k8s — silo umbrella chart & deploy entrypoint

> [apps](../../README.md) › [_infra](../README.md) › deploy-k8s

<!-- No import alias: this deployable is a Helm umbrella chart plus a deploy script.
     Named by its `project.json` (`deploy-k8s`). This README is the overview altitude;
     the deep detail lives in the linked sub-docs. -->

## What it owns

This is the **install root** for one **silo** — one customer's isolated slice of OpenCrane. The
trusted services run in the release namespace; untrusted personal-agent Jobs run in a sibling runtime
namespace owned by the same release. Nothing is shared with other customers. Everything else under `apps/` ships a small
Helm chart; this app is the **umbrella chart** (`opencrane-silo`) that pulls those deployment
contracts together into one release, plus `deploy.sh`, the entrypoint that installs and upgrades it.

Think of it as the assembly point: each app owns its own workload templates, and this chart composes
them — unchanged — with one shared release context. It renders nothing customer-specific itself; it just
wires the pieces and the per-silo networking together.

A silo installs **only** its own namespaced app releases. Cluster-wide controllers (ingress,
CloudNativePG, cert-manager) and serving DNS are external prerequisites a silo never installs.
"External" here means outside the organisation release: a cluster operator may explicitly install
the pinned development controller set with `platform/bootstrap-prerequisites.sh`, but `deploy.sh`
never invokes that helper. Dependencies resolve from `Chart.lock` via `helm dep build` (pinned,
reproducible) — never from open version ranges.

The artifact preprocessor runs in its own PSA-restricted sibling namespace with a fixed zero-RBAC
identity, bounded scratch, and no ArtifactStore route. The personal `agent-runtime` image is
deliberately absent from the long-lived Deployment rollup. It is not a
long-lived silo service: the agent controller creates its bounded, suspended Job for each authorised
run attempt and commits the Kubernetes-issued Job identity to OpenCrane. Workload lifetime and
Kubernetes identity therefore remain tied to that attempt. The release still owns the runtime
namespace, its zero-RBAC ServiceAccount, default-deny and fixed-egress policies, and a uniquely named
cluster-scoped admission policy that permits only the exact digest-pinned Job shape and its one-time
unsuspend transition. An aggregate ResourceQuota bounds conforming Jobs, Pods, CPU, and memory even
if the controller identity is compromised. The admission boundary requires Kubernetes 1.30+.

## Public surface

`Entrypoint: deploy.sh` — the per-ClusterTenant silo deploy profile, a thin wrapper over the shared
install core (`platform/k8s-deploy.sh`). It requires a base domain, a ClusterTenant name, one
`--first-user-email` value, and one pre-created PostgreSQL basic-auth Secret per logical database
(server, obot, litellm). The named email is non-secret and only selects the verified OIDC identity
that can claim the silo's one subject-bound Owner row at first login; deployment never writes a user
row directly. A new silo can also pass `--initial-model-provider` with
`OPENCRANE_INITIAL_MODEL_API_KEY` in its environment; the key never enters Helm values and is
registered through the release-local LiteLLM before the server becomes ready.

`Entrypoint: teardown.sh` — retires one exact standalone silo after checking the kubectl context,
tenant, namespace, exact chart identities from `releases/<version>.json`, retained CloudNativePG
data ownership, and a tenant-name confirmation. It requires explicit evidence that the matching DNS host and Zitadel callback have
already been retired; it never guesses which external record or identity-provider application to
change. The caller must also name the currently protected tenant explicitly; environment-specific
tenant policy is never hard-coded in the reusable teardown engine. The retry-safe cleanup uninstalls only the tenant and PostgreSQL releases, then removes the
exact keep-marked database resources, their doubly-labelled data volumes, release-derived auxiliary
namespaces, and exact tenant-suffixed cluster role bindings. Shared controllers, custom resource
definitions, ingress, certificate management, ComputeClass, and the protected active tenant remain
outside its deletion surface.

## Boundary

The umbrella renders no business logic and installs no cluster-wide controller. It composes app-owned
templates, the server and runtime namespaces, per-silo `NetworkPolicies`, and the runtime Job's
release-scoped `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`; it does not own the workloads themselves (each app does) or
the shared substrate helpers (the `k8s-platform` library does). Self-service ClusterTenant management and
billing are OFF — a silo serves exactly one ClusterTenant.

## Dependency direction

An app entrypoint (`type:app`); it composes app template libraries and the `k8s-platform` substrate. No
package imports it.

## Runtime & config

- Umbrella chart: `Chart.yaml` (`opencrane-silo`), values in `values.yaml`, schema in
  `values.schema.json`, pins in `Chart.lock`.
- `agentController.runtimeNamespace` — optional DNS-label override for the sibling runtime namespace;
  empty derives `<release>-runtime`, and the chart rejects the trusted server namespace.
- `artifactPreprocessor` — disabled until its immutable image digest is supplied; when enabled, the
  worker runs in a dedicated restricted namespace and receives only ephemeral scratch plus
  broker/DNS/optional-telemetry egress.
- `agentController.runtimeQuota` — aggregate Job, Pod, CPU, and memory ceilings for the dedicated
  untrusted runtime namespace.
- `opencrane-skill-authoring.skillAuthoring` — the separate, default-deny candidate-skill namespace
  and aggregate Job quota; it contains no standing worker.
- `opencrane-tool-runner.toolRunner` — the separate, default-deny tenant-tool namespace and aggregate
  Job quota; it contains no standing worker.
- `--first-user-email` — required standalone-onboarding input. It is matched exactly against an
  IdP-verified email after a browser login on this silo host, then records only that identity's OIDC
  `sub` as the local Owner. It is distinct from `--platform-operator-seed-email` and grants no
  platform-wide operator privilege. The deploy engine rejects an issuer change after this contract
  exists, because a `sub` is scoped to its original OIDC issuer. Later upgrades must restate that
  same `--oidc-issuer-url`; they may not use chart `--values` or `--reset-values`, which could
  replace or erase the binding.
- `--initial-model-provider` plus `OPENCRANE_INITIAL_MODEL_API_KEY` — optional bootstrap of the first
  supported model provider. The engine writes the key to the release-local provider-custody Secret;
  the server then registers its encrypted LiteLLM credential and catalogue before accepting work.
- `teardown.sh --release-version <version> --confirm-retire <tenant>` — destructive retirement; the repository-owned `protected-cluster-tenants.json` registry blocks active tenants independently of caller input
  requires the exact installed repository version, tenant text, kubectl context, and external
  retirement acknowledgements for the derived DNS host and Zitadel callback. The release manifest
  binds both expected chart identities exactly; a prefix match is never accepted. Run it with
  `--preflight` first to inventory ownership without changing the cluster.
- Reusable environment/multi-instance profiles live under `values/` and `platform/values/`.
- `npx nx run deploy-k8s:test` and `npx nx run deploy-k8s:helm-lint` build a disposable copy from
  the committed `Chart.lock`, linked to the current app-owned chart sources. They therefore validate
  the release contract without rewriting the tracked `charts/*.tgz` archives.
- `npx nx run deploy-k8s:develop-smoke` creates a disposable k3d cluster, builds the five enabled
  OpenCrane-owned workload images from the checkout, installs the current silo through `deploy.sh`,
  and fails unless PostgreSQL isolation, every enabled Deployment, the self-signed Certificate, and
  the TLS `/healthz` ingress are healthy. CI runs it for deployment-surface pull requests and every
  push to `develop`; it never substitutes for backup/recovery or production-cluster qualification.

## Sub-docs (the deep detail)

- **[platform/README.md](platform/README.md)** — the cluster and release substrate: the `k8s-platform`
  Helm library (labels, names, RBAC, endpoint/database/identity/observability helpers), the
  `k8s-deploy.sh` install engine, explicit shared-controller bootstrap, OIDC configuration, cluster
  provisioning, Terraform, values profiles, and the k3d conformance tests.
