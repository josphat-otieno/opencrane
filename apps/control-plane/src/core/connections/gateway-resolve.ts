 * The authoritative routing decision the identity-routing gateway proxy needs to

 *  - `user`        — the IdP-verified identity the proxy logs / rate-limits on.
 *  - `tenant`      — the resolved per-user OpenClaw tenant (one pod per user).
 *  - `podService`  — the in-cluster Service the proxy reverse-proxies to. The proxy
 *                    composes the FQDN + port itself (`<name>.<namespace>.svc:<port>`),
 *                    so transport details never leak into the control plane.

 * email — there is no request-supplied tenant input, and the resolution is the same
 * fail-closed email→tenant rule used by `/pod-token` (see
 * {@link _ResolveCallerClusterTenant}): zero matches or an ambiguous (>1) match
 * resolves to a forbidden outcome, never an arbitrary pick. This is the routing-level
 * half of cross-tenant safety; the pod-level half is per-pod owner pinning (CONN.10).
 *
 * `scopeClusterTenant` narrows the lookup to the silo the connection is coming in on
 * (derived from the request host by the caller). A human who owns a workspace in more
 * than one silo would otherwise be ambiguous (>1) and fail closed everywhere; scoping
 * routes them to the pod for the host they are connecting through. Self-validating: a
 * foreign/unknown silo yields zero rows → NO_TENANT, never a foreign pod.
 *
 * The pod's namespace is re-derived from the tenant's owning org
 * (`opencrane-<clusterTenantRef>`); a tenant with no org ref (legacy single-namespace
 * install) falls back to the control plane's own namespace.
 *
 * @param prisma             - Prisma client for the email→tenant lookup.
 * @param defaultNamespace   - Namespace for tenants with no org ref (the CP's own ns).
 * @param email              - The session's verified email claim.
 * @param sub                - The session subject (logged identity); falls back to email.
 * @param scopeClusterTenant - Optional silo to scope the lookup to; omit for a global match.
 * @returns A forward target, or a fail-closed reason.
