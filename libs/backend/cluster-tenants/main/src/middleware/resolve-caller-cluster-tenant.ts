/**
 * Resolve the caller's ClusterTenant from their IdP-verified email, fail-closed. At most one tenant
 * may match, and its `clusterTenantRef` is returned; null on a missing/ambiguous email or any lookup
 * failure — never an arbitrary pick, never taken from request input.
 *
 * Single source of truth (Track AIR) for the ClusterTenant scope guard (mutation authz), the
 * read-time scope filters (the savings-recommendation feed + the metrics proxy), and `/auth/me`
 * introspection. Keep these on one implementation so the fail-closed rule cannot drift between
 * call sites.
 *
 * `scopeClusterTenant` narrows the lookup to a single silo BEFORE the at-most-one rule is applied.
 * Without it the lookup is global, so a human who legitimately owns workspaces in more than one
 * ClusterTenant is ambiguous (>1 match) and fail-closes to null. Callers that already know which
 * silo is in play pass it so that human resolves correctly:
 *  - `/auth/me` derives it from the request host (the org the caller is currently viewing);
 *  - the mutation guard passes the targeted resource's owning ClusterTenant (a membership check:
 *    "does the caller own a workspace in this silo?").
 * The filter is self-validating — an unknown or foreign silo simply yields zero rows (null/deny),
 * never an arbitrary pick.
 *
 * @param prisma             - Prisma client for the email→tenant→clusterTenantRef lookup.
 * @param email              - The session's verified email claim, if any.
 * @param scopeClusterTenant - Optional silo to scope the lookup to; omit for a global email match.
 * @returns The caller's owning ClusterTenant ref, or null when unresolved/ambiguous.
