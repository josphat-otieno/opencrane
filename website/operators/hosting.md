# Hosting and deployment

OpenCrane installs as one **organisation silo** on a conformant Kubernetes cluster. The
umbrella chart composes the trusted services and separate, restricted Job namespaces.

> See also: [Deployment configuration](/operators/deployment-configuration) (public Helm inputs),
> [Organisation boundary](/operators/organisation-boundary) (what one silo serves),
> [Networking and isolation](/operators/networking) (allowed traffic), and
> [Runbook](/operators/runbook) (health and recovery).

## Deployment shape

```text
Kubernetes cluster
└── OpenCrane silo for one ClusterTenant
    ├── trusted namespace
    │   ├── OpenCrane server and UI
    │   ├── agent controller
    │   └── supporting services
    ├── personal runtime namespace
    │   └── fresh Job per admitted attempt
    ├── managed runtime namespace
    │   └── fresh Job per scheduled or managed attempt
    └── restricted worker namespaces
        ├── skill authoring
        ├── tool runner
        └── artifact preprocessor
```

The runtime image is not a long-lived Deployment. The controller creates a suspended Job
only after OpenCrane has durably admitted the run, then releases that exact Kubernetes UID.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.30 or newer for the stable validating-admission boundary.
- A default StorageClass.
- A CNI that enforces `NetworkPolicy`.
- Ingress, DNS and certificate controllers when exposing a public host.
- PostgreSQL credentials supplied through Kubernetes Secrets.
- Immutable image digests for the controller and runtime.

## Minimal operator handoff

Provide the target Kubernetes context, ClusterTenant and base domain; OIDC issuer, client ID and
confidential-client secret; the first operator email or IdP group mapping; and three distinct
PostgreSQL bootstrap credential Secrets. Add a namespace-local registry pull Secret only for private
images. The script derives the namespace and default OIDC callback, and creates the OIDC Secret.

::: warning
Do not put OIDC or registry secret bytes in Helm values, committed files, or shell history.
:::

## Install

Use the app-owned entrypoint:

```bash
export OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://identity.example.com
export OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<organisation-client-id>
export OPENCRANE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret-manager-value>
export OPENCRANE_PLATFORM_OPERATOR_SEED_EMAIL=operator@example.com

apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/deploy.sh \
  --base-domain opencrane.example.com \
  --cluster-tenant acme \
  --acme-email operator@example.com \
  --postgres-credentials-secret opencrane-postgres-bootstrap \
  --obot-postgres-credentials-secret opencrane-obot-postgres-bootstrap \
  --litellm-postgres-credentials-secret opencrane-litellm-postgres-bootstrap
# Add --registry-pull-secret opencrane-ghcr-pull for private images.
```

The script delegates to `apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform/k8s-deploy.sh` and installs the
`opencrane-silo` umbrella chart. It does not install a second management plane. The three
PostgreSQL bootstrap Secrets must already exist in the target namespace and use distinct
credentials.

The public host must already resolve to the ingress address. The entrypoint uses Let's Encrypt
HTTP-01 and needs `--acme-email`; it fails before applying a self-signed certificate.

::: warning
Do not deploy the personal and managed runtimes into the trusted server namespace. The server
validates that all three namespaces are distinct and refuses to start on a collapsed boundary.

## What the release owns

| Surface | Ownership |
|---|---|
| Trusted applications | App-owned chart templates composed by the umbrella |
| Runtime Jobs | Created and conditionally released by `agent-controller` |
| Runtime namespace floor | Pod Security Standards, quota, default-deny policy and admission policy |
| Run authority | PostgreSQL-backed OpenCrane server |
| Cluster-wide controllers | External prerequisites, not installed as silo business workloads |
