/**
 * Resolve the caller's ClusterTenant from their stable IdP subject and authoritative organisation
 * memberships, fail-closed. At most one membership may match, and its `clusterTenant` is returned;
 * null on a missing/ambiguous subject or any lookup failure — never an arbitrary pick and never
 * taken from request input.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the ClusterTenant scope guard (mutation authz) and `/auth/me`
 * introspection. Keep these on one implementation so the fail-closed rule cannot drift between
 * call sites.
 *
 * `scopeClusterTenant` narrows the lookup to a single silo BEFORE the at-most-one rule is applied.
 * Without it the lookup is global, so a human who legitimately belongs to more than one
 * ClusterTenant is ambiguous (>1 match) and fail-closes to null. Callers that already know which
 * silo is in play pass it so that human resolves correctly:
 *  - `/auth/me` derives it from the request host (the org the caller is currently viewing);
 *  - the mutation guard passes the targeted resource's owning ClusterTenant.
 * The filter is self-validating — an unknown or foreign silo simply yields zero rows (null/deny),
 * never an arbitrary pick.
 *
 * @param prisma             - Prisma client for the subject-to-membership lookup.
 * @param subject            - Stable subject from the established OIDC session.
 * @param scopeClusterTenant - Optional silo to scope the lookup to; omit for a global subject match.
 * @returns The caller's ClusterTenant, or null when unresolved or ambiguous.
