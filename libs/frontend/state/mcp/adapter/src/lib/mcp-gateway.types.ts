 * Implementations live in this `adapter` lib; the binding is provided in the
 * app's `app.config.ts`.

 * and it is write-only: a stored credential is never returned by any read
 * method. The agent/LLM/chat never sees a token — it only ever receives a
 * connection URL — so no method here exposes raw credential material.
