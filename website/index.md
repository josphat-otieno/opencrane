features:
  - title: Personal assistants at scale
    details: >-
      Each employee gets an isolated OpenClaw pod with dedicated, encrypted
      storage — from 10 to 10,000 employees on the same architecture.
  - title: Vendor independence
    details: >-
      Choose your LLM provider — Claude, GPT, or open-source models — and keep
      your proprietary skills in your own repository. No lock-in.
  - title: Data sovereignty
    details: >-
      Organizational knowledge, conversations, and skills stay on your network.
      Full audit trails, RBAC, and data residency under your control.
  - title: API-first & headless
    details: >-
      Every capability is reachable through the versioned REST API and the oc
      CLI. The OpenAPI 3.1 spec is the contract; external UIs are just clients.
  - title: IAM-first identity
    details: >-
      Workload Identity for pods, OIDC for operators, audience-bound projected
      tokens for in-cluster planes. Secrets never reach tenant pods.
  - title: Self-hosted, cloud-agnostic
    details: >-
      On-prem by default with optional cloud adapters. Helm + Terraform IaC;
      runs with zero cloud SDKs present.
