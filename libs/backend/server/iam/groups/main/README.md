# @opencrane/backend/server/iam/groups — named sets of people you can grant access to at once

## What it owns

This package is part of **IAM** — *identity and access management*, the side of OpenCrane that
answers **who is making this request, and are they allowed to do this?** Groups owns the idea of a
named set of people — a team, a department, a project — so that access can be given to the whole set
at once instead of one person at a time.

A group is a reusable *subject* that authorization may point at: instead of naming Ana, Ben, and Cara
separately, policy can name the design-team group. This package owns the operator-facing group
management API (`/api/v1/groups`) and the stored membership that backs it. Some
groups mirror the login groups a person's identity provider reports (kept in sync at sign-in by the
[identity](../../identity/main/README.md) package); others are curated by operators here.

```

 ┌───────────────────────────────┐

 └───────────────────────────────┘
        │  authorization may use the group as a subject
        ▼
  authorization evaluates the separately owned entitlement
```

**In this flow:** [identity](../../identity/main/README.md) · [authorization](../../authorization/main/README.md)

Invariant: a group is only a named set of members — it neither owns entitlements nor makes access
decisions. Authorization grants are created and evaluated by their owning domains. Mounted at
`/api/v1/groups`.

## Public surface

- `groupsRouter` and its route types — the `/api/v1/groups` management API.
- The group logic in `core/groups.logic` — membership create, update, delete, and response shapes.
- `_GroupsOpenapiPaths` — the OpenAPI (REST API description) path fragment this domain contributes to the aggregated spec.

## Boundary

Consumed by the server's HTTP composition root and by [api-spec](../../../api-spec/main/README.md).
It owns group definitions and their members; it deliberately does not persist or resolve effective
access. Those entitlements belong to [authorization](../../authorization/main/README.md).

## Dependency direction

Tagged `scope:groups`: it may depend only on `scope:groups` and `scope:shared` — never on apps or
other sibling domains.

## Data & persistence

Owns the `Group` model in `apps/opencrane/prisma/schema/groups.prisma`.
