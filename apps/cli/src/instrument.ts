/**
 * OpenTelemetry bootstrap for the `oc` CLI.
 *
 * A complete no-op unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set (the default on a
 * laptop), so normal CLI use carries zero overhead. When an endpoint *is*
 * configured (e.g. `oc` running in CI against the cluster), the auto HTTP
 * instrumentation propagates trace context to the opencrane-ui so a command
 * and the server work it triggers appear in one trace.
 *
 * Imported first in `index.ts` so instrumentation is installed before the
 * contracts HTTP client loads.
