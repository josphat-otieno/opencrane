# Cloud DNS module — managed zone + the shared zone-write identity (external-dns)
#
# Owns the platform's managed zone and the FIXED, install-time records the chart
# needs the moment it comes up:
#   - `*.<domain>`          → ingress IP  (resolves every ORG APEX `<org>.<domain>`)
#   - `<domain>` (apex)     → ingress IP
#   - opencrane-ui host    → ingress IP  (the fixed super-operator host, distinct
#                                           from the org wildcard)
#
# Per-host / per-org records are NOT written by Terraform. external-dns owns them at
# RUNTIME: the cluster-tenants operator declares each org's records as a namespaced
# `DNSEndpoint` CR and the external-dns controller reconciles them into THIS zone (run
# with --source=crd, scoped to <domain>). Terraform therefore provisions only the zone,
# the install-time platform records, and the zone-WRITE identity the controllers share —
# it must NOT write per-org/per-host records itself (the old imperative Cloud DNS client
# is gone). See dns-endpoint.client.ts in the fleet-operator app (now in the WeOwnAI repo,
# italanta/opencrane#150).
#
# Identity vs records are DECOUPLED by dependency. The zone + the shared DNS-writer GSA
# need nothing from the running app, so they are created whenever this module runs (i.e.
# `enable_cloud_dns`) — that is what lets a cluster-only Terraform flow provision the
# zone-write identity up front so cert-manager DNS-01 can issue, with `--dns-writer-gsa`
# reading the `dns_writer_service_account_email` output. The install-time A-records DO
# need the ingress IP, so they are gated on `ingress_ip` and skipped until it is known
# (pass it, or re-apply once the app is up).
