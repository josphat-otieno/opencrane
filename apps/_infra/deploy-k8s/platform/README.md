# deploy-k8s platform internals

This directory is the cluster and release substrate owned by `apps/_infra/deploy-k8s`. It is kept
as an internal subtree—not a top-level `libs` package—because the deploy-k8s application is its only
local source consumer.

## Contents

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Chart.yaml`, `templates/` | Helm library chart providing labels, names, RBAC, endpoint, database, identity, and observability helpers to the parent release. It renders no workload by itself. |
| `k8s-deploy.sh` | Provider-neutral install and upgrade engine used by the release wrapper. It republishes each database consumer's URI and waits for the exact server, LiteLLM, and Obot workloads to restart, because Kubernetes environment variables do not reload Secret changes. Its optional `--verify` check reports pod readiness, DNS resolution, and public server/database health without changing deployment success. |
| `bootstrap-prerequisites.sh` | Explicit operator bootstrap for the pinned ingress-nginx, cert-manager, and CloudNativePG cluster-wide controllers, plus the narrowly selected GKE Autopilot database-proof ComputeClass. It validates the exact Kubernetes context and reserved regional address before mutation, fails closed around existing foreign resources, and installs resource-bounded development profiles from `values/prerequisites/`. It is not invoked by a silo deployment. |
| `prerequisite-chart-lock.sh` | Immutable upstream chart coordinates, SHA-256 archive identities, and complete rendered cluster-scoped resource inventories consumed by the bootstrap and render contract. |
| `configure-oidc.sh` | Surgical OIDC configuration for an existing installation. |
| `provision.sh` | Optional local, GKE Autopilot, or VPS cluster provisioning invoked before deployment. The GKE path bootstraps a private, versioned Terraform-state bucket in the cluster region; set `OPENCRANE_TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET` only when the deterministic `<project>-<cluster>-tfstate` name cannot be used. |
| `terraform/` | GKE Autopilot with regional CMEK, plus opt-in networking, DNS, and Artifact Registry resources. Application charts remain owned by `deploy.sh`. |
| `values/` | Reusable environment and multi-instance deployment profiles. |
| `tests/` | Rendered contract checks plus the blocking disposable-k3d current-silo smoke used on `develop`. |

`tests/develop-smoke.sh` exercises the real silo deploy entrypoint with images built from the checked
out commit. It supplies only disposable OIDC and database credentials, installs pinned cert-manager,
CloudNativePG, and the CI-only expandable hostpath CSI driver, then fails on any enabled workload,
database-isolation, Certificate, or TLS `/healthz` failure. Set `KEEP_CLUSTER=1` for local diagnosis.
It is intentionally a smoke gate: backup/restore and production storage, DNS, and transport remain
separate live qualifications.

Business logic does not belong here. Server-process infrastructure belongs in `libs/backend/_server`;
backend capabilities belong in `libs/backend/server`; independently owned third-party workloads
belong in sibling `apps/_infra/<service>` projects.

## OIDC upgrades

A fresh OIDC deployment must provide its confidential-client secret through
`OPENCRANE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` or `--oidc-client-secret`; the engine creates the release-local
`opencrane-oidc` Secret only from that input. Later upgrades may omit it when that Secret already
contains both the client and session keys. The engine retains the existing Secret in that case, so
ordinary image or configuration rollouts do not rotate login sessions or require an IdP secret to
be supplied again. A missing or incomplete existing Secret still fails closed.

The engine always enables LiteLLM's database-backed model store for a managed silo. It supplies
the release-local LiteLLM database and stable encryption salt, then OpenCrane registers provider
models through LiteLLM's admin API. Leaving that store disabled would retain a provider credential
but make model registration fail at server startup.

## Shared controller bootstrap

Cluster-wide controllers remain outside the organisation release boundary. A cluster operator may
install the supported development substrate explicitly after provisioning a GKE Autopilot cluster:

```bash
apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform/bootstrap-prerequisites.sh \
  --context gke_PROJECT_REGION_CLUSTER \
  --project-id PROJECT \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --ingress-address-name RESERVED_ADDRESS \
  --yes
```

The command downloads each locked archive once, verifies its committed SHA-256, renders that local
archive before it changes the cluster, then installs the same bytes with atomic, waited Helm upgrades.
Its complete cluster-scoped inventory prevents accidental adoption of foreign CRDs, RBAC, ingress
classes, or webhooks. Bootstrap-owned namespaces carry explicit retry markers so an atomic first-run
failure can be retried without accepting an arbitrary pre-existing namespace. The GKE profile keeps
cert-manager leader election in its own namespace because Autopilot denies third-party writes to its
managed `kube-system` namespace. It never installs
external-dns or DNS credentials and it does not create a cluster-wide certificate issuer. Each silo
owns its namespaced HTTP-01 `Issuer`; the operator creates the serving DNS record only after the
ingress Service reports the reserved address.

The bootstrap also owns `opencrane-database-proof`, a GKE Autopilot ComputeClass used only by the
short-lived PostgreSQL privilege-proof Job through `values/postgres-gke-autopilot.yaml`. Its explicit
`ScaleUpAnyway` policy allows the proof to receive capacity when GKE system balloon Pods reserve all
otherwise idle capacity. Its ten-GiB boot disk is the GKE minimum, sufficient for the Job's three
one-GiB ephemeral-storage requests and small enough for the development SSD quota. It uses the
two-vCPU, two-GiB `e2-small` machine type because GKE only permits an explicit boot disk with a
machine type or family, not with a `podFamily`; this makes the node-based cost bounded to the
short-lived proof Job. It does not change the Job's database grants, credentials, network path, or
completion requirement.

The pinned ingress-nginx release is accepted only for this single-silo development qualification.
The upstream project is archived, so a supported ingress controller must replace it before a
production or shared multi-tenant deployment.
