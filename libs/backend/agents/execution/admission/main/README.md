## What it owns

This package is the entry into the shared execution flow for both a user's personal conversation
and a managed agent. An authenticated request has already established its identity before it
arrives here. Admission then composes current evidence, immutable input assembly, the durable run
repository, and one app-owned process-local capacity boundary.

```
 authenticated request ............. browser or service identity + current evidence
                 │
                 ▼
 ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ execution/admission  ◄── HERE           │ one shared capacity grant at process/silo/service
 │ compose inputs + runs + evidence        │ then assemble and persist one snapshot
 └────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 │  admitted run id / stable denial
                 ▼
 execution/runs ........ durable run + snapshot + outbox
```

**In this flow:** [agent services](../../../../server/agents/agent-services/main/README.md) supplies
the authorized managed request and evidence · [inputs](../../inputs/main/README.md) assembles the
immutable snapshot · [runs](../../runs/main/README.md) persists the durable run authority

One shared gate serves every personal and managed admission path in the server process. That is
load-bearing: separate entrypoint gates could each consume the same database budget. Admission is
granted only when the process, silo, and exact agent service all have capacity. A missing, stale,
overloaded, or inconsistent input produces a denial before unbounded persistence work begins.

Personal admission has two bounded stages. A synthetic per-silo preflight lane first limits its
duplicate-key and participant-thread reads, before a browser request can touch PostgreSQL. Once
that lane has derived the real personal AgentService, the normal process/silo/service gate limits
the final transaction that rechecks all mutable authority and persists the snapshot. The first lane
does not grant product authority; it is overload protection for the read path.

## Public surface

- `__CreateManagedRunAdmissionPort(prisma, capacityGate, evidenceAuthority)` composes the managed
  port from the durable repository, a mounted-key-backed evidence authority, and the app-owned
  shared gate.
- `__CreatePersonalRunAdmissionPort(prisma, capacityGate, membershipEvidence)` composes the
  personal port from neutral mounted-key fleet-membership trust. It derives an AgentService from a
  participant-owned thread and verifies exactly one signed personal membership assertion in the
  final admission transaction.
- `_CreateRunAdmissionCapacityGate(policy)` creates the one hierarchical process/silo/service gate
  injected into both personal and managed ports.
- `__CreatePersonalRunAdmissionRouter(dependencies)` adapts the exact two-field browser request to
  the personal port; session principal and host-derived silo are the only identity coordinates.
- `_PersonalRunAdmissionOpenapiPaths` contributes the `POST /api/v1/me/runs` request and response
  contract to the server-owned API specification.
- `PersonalRunAdmissionPort` and `RunAdmissionCapacityGate` are the only cross-package port types;
  repository, router-dependency, and preflight types remain internal implementation detail.
- `__ReadRunAdmissionConcurrencyPolicy(environment?)` reads and validates the two bounded capacity
  settings. The optional map exists for deterministic configuration tests; production uses
  `process.env`.

## Boundary

Consumed by the OpenCrane server composition root, which creates one shared gate and passes it to
the personal API, run-now router, and scheduler. This package does not authenticate HTTP requests,
authorize agent service publication, schedule work, dispatch Kubernetes Jobs, or execute a run. It
accepts server-owned identity evidence and delegates durable snapshot and run rules to their owning
packages.

The in-memory gates are overload protection, not product authority. Silo identity and admission
eligibility are still re-derived and persisted by the durable execution packages. A process
restart may clear waiting work but cannot admit an unauthorized run or rewrite a committed one.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `scope:execution-admission`: it may depend only on `scope:execution-admission`,
`scope:execution-inputs`, `scope:execution-runs`, `scope:agent-services`, and `scope:shared` — never
on apps, transport adapters, runtime Jobs, or unrelated backend domains.

## Runtime & config

- `AGENT_RUN_ADMISSION_MAX_CONCURRENT` defaults to `2` and must be an integer from `1` through `2`.
- `AGENT_RUN_ADMISSION_MAX_QUEUED` defaults to `10` and must be an integer from `0` through `100`.

Malformed values fail server startup. The global process ceiling is twice the per-service policy,
while each silo and exact agent service retain the configured limits.
