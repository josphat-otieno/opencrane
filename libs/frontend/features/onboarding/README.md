# @opencrane/features/onboarding — governed persona onboarding

> [frontend](../../README.md) › [features](../README.md) › onboarding

## What it owns

This feature owns the signed-in person's routed persona onboarding shell. One explicit lifecycle
switch selects an interview, resolution, review, or ready component from the authoritative server
projection. The persona authority supplies the reviewed questions, records each choice, computes any
tie, creates the immutable draft, and activates only the exact revision the person approves. After
approval, the first-chat screen renders the separately authoritative, reviewed three-answer
bootstrap exchange.

**In this flow:** [state/onboarding](../../state/onboarding/README.md) ·
[state/persona/adapter](../../state/persona/adapter/README.md)

Each state component receives read-only evidence and emits typed intents. The component-scoped
`PersonaOnboardingStore` owns loading, single-flight command admission, errors, adoption of the
returned projection, and the post-activation route read. The shell owns only the resulting browser
navigation. Refreshing, changing device, or retrying resumes the server-confirmed position;
a failed save never advances the screen. The survey and first-chat composer hold only the unsaved
input currently visible. Starting an interrupted review draft, the first conversation, and its final
conclusion are explicit owner commands. The first-chat page is a thin route composition over its
component-scoped store and a pure snapshot-to-view mapper. The store owns its read, explicit command
sequencing, retry identity, conflicts, and question-keyed draft; the routed page owns only typed
intent delegation and authority-derived navigation. A failed answer retains its exact text and
idempotency key while the browser can neither select the next question nor assert completion.

## Public surface

- `ONBOARDING_ROUTES` — lazy `/onboarding` shell and `/onboarding/chat` route mounted by
  `opencrane-ui`.
- The internal `PersonaFirstChatComponent` presentation boundary is covered in Storybook for the
  authoritative transcript, provenance, controlled answer, and finite recovery states.

## Boundary

This package composes shared journey, progress, choice-card, and persona-summary elements. State
components do not inject services, navigate between lifecycle screens, call HTTP, calculate persona
scores, persist browser flags, or activate a persona; those remain behind the shell, state-layer port,
and authenticated server API. The browser also cannot select bootstrap content, choose the next
question, run a model, or assert onboarding completion. The first-chat screen is a deterministic
onboarding exchange, not a general chat client.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `scope:persona-onboarding`, `type:lib`, `layer:frontend`, and `frontend-role:feature`. The
role constraint admits only shared elements and onboarding state; it cannot import the HTTP adapter,
another feature, an app, or backend source.
