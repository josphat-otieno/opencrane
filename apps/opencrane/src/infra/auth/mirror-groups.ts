/**
 * Groups are Zitadel project roles under the convention `group:<scope>:<name>` (#126 S4b,
 * decided 2026-07-05). A member's group roles ride in their token's role claims, so at login
 * `AuthUser.groups` already carries every `group:*` the user holds. This module mirrors those
 * claims into the silo's persisted `Group.members` so operator-facing group management, grants,
 * and audit see the IdP-sourced membership — the token stays the live source for request-time
 * `{groups}`, this is the durable projection of it.
 *
 * Scope-aware retrieval keys on the live token groups, so this mirror is the persistence half,
 * not on the hot path.
 *
 * The mirror is bidirectional at login: the user's claims are ADDED into `Group.members`, and
 * stale entries are PRUNED — a subject sitting in a convention (`group:`-prefixed) Group but
 * absent from the login's claims was dropped in the Console, so their entry is removed.
 * Operator-curated groups (non-convention names) are never touched, and an emptied group is
 * retained (it may still carry grants).
 *
 * DEFERRED (tracked on #126): opencrane-ui group mutations writing Zitadel role grants via
 * the fleet management client — for now org admins manage group roles in the Zitadel Console
 * they own (the decided native primitive).
