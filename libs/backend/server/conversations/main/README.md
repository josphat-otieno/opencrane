# @opencrane/backend/server/conversations — participant conversation authority

## What it owns

This package owns the signed-in participant's conversation API and the display-safe replay of
agent-session events. It creates conversations in exactly one immutable mode: `agent_session`,
`direct`, or `group`. An agent session binds one agent service; direct and group conversations do
not bind an agent and their ordinary messages never manufacture runs.

Message admission dispatches through the persisted mode strategy. A direct or group message commits
as a canonical message without an `AgentRun`. An agent-session message enters the internal personal
run-admission port so the message, immutable input snapshot, run, and first dispatch intent commit in
one transaction. A single active foreground run blocks another agent-session message. The public API
does not expose a separate run-start route.

Archive and close are deliberately different. Archive is reversible and affects only one
participant's list. Close is permanent, applies to the conversation, and makes it read-only. Each
participant separately records the first visible position, the last read position, and an optional
access-ended position; reads are clipped to those bounds and writes require continuing access.

The database allocates one monotonically increasing position across message and run-event timeline
entries. Timeline entries hold typed references to canonical rows, never copied payloads. Replay
uses an opaque `{ conversationId, position }` cursor, reads only linked run events, and projects an
allow-listed Agent User Interface (AG-UI) server-sent event snapshot. Unknown events remain visible
as a bounded custom event, but proofs, credentials, fences, and provider metadata never cross the
browser boundary.

The snapshot has no live tail or wake-up loop. The server mounts the adapter only when its
controller-issued `CHANNEL_REPLAY_ROUTE_ID` is configured; the controller must register that exact
endpoint as the current `events.read` channel route. Without both facts, no replay route is exposed.

## Public surface

- `_CreateSelfConversationsRouter` composes the participant-bound list, create, open, message,
  archive, and close API over Prisma and the internal run-admission port.
- `_CreateConversationReplayRepository` composes replay over one `RepeatableRead` transaction so
  access-ending races cannot expose later events.
- `__CreateConversationReplayRouter` mounts internal context-authorized AG-UI replay.
- `_CreateSelfConversationReplayRouter` mounts the participant-authenticated replay route.
- `_SelfConversationsOpenapiPaths` and `_SelfConversationReplayOpenapiPaths` contribute those APIs
  to the server-owned OpenAPI document.

## Boundary

The self API receives only server-derived session and host identity. It never accepts silo,
membership, user, agent authority, or run identifiers as browser-selected trust facts. It creates a
run only by calling the internal execution-admission port for an eligible agent-session message; it
does not assemble inputs, dispatch workloads, or execute agents. The channel replay route separately
requires a consumed one-use context and the exact controller-selected route identifier.

Missing, foreign, closed, access-ended, wrong-mode, duplicate-body, and active-run writes fail
closed through stable denials. Replay likewise returns no rows when participant, silo, cursor, or
visibility bounds do not match. Every self-service read and write also rechecks active organisation
membership inside its own database snapshot, so revocation closes list, open, retry, archive, close,
message, and replay authority immediately. Admission overload is returned as `capacity_limited`
rather than being misreported as a persistence outage.

## Dependency direction

Tagged `scope:conversations` at the backend layer, it may use only its own scope,
`scope:auth`, `scope:channel-targets`, and shared contracts. The auth edge resolves request identity
only. It cannot import an app, frontend state, or deployment package.

## Data & persistence

Owns participant-facing operations over `Conversation`, `ConversationParticipant`,
`ConversationMessage`, and `ConversationTimelineEntry`. The write authority uses serialisable
transactions and projects create, archive, and close results from the same authorised write
snapshot. The replay adapter is read-only and joins timeline references to `RunEvent`; neither path
reconstructs order from client or run timestamps. All paths depend on current active `OrgMembership`
in the caller's host-selected silo; participant rows alone never preserve authority after revocation.
