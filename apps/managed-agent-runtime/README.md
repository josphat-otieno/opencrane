# managed-agent-runtime — the managed-agent Job plane

> [apps](../README.md) › managed-agent-runtime

<!-- No import alias: this is a chart/deploy-only app, not an importable package. -->

## What it owns

This app owns the **deployment surface for managed agents** — the agents an organisation
runs on a schedule, distinct from a person's personal agent. It is **chart/deploy-only**: a
dedicated Kubernetes namespace, one bounded connector-scoped ServiceAccount, and the
default-deny + port-bounded explicit-egress NetworkPolicies that fence that namespace. A
namespace-wide Pod, Job, attempt-key Secret, CPU, and memory quota limits aggregate consumption even when many
admission-valid Jobs are requested. It ships no application source and builds no image of its own.

Managed runtime Pods run the **same image as the personal runtime** (built by
[`agent-runtime`](../agent-runtime/README.md) — one shared build artifact, never duplicated Python).
The two planes differ only in identity and reach: the launcher projects a *managed* identity profile
(the `managed-agent-runtime-*` ServiceAccount class and the distinct
`opencrane-managed-agent-runtime` projected-token audience), and this namespace's NetworkPolicies
allow egress only to the control-plane stream and the channel-proxy / artifact / memory-gateway /
LiteLLM / Obot services a managed run needs — everything else is denied.

```text
 managed AgentService + schedule (control API)
        │  scheduler admits a due run; launcher builds a managed-profile Job
        ▼
 ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  managed-agent-runtime  ◄── HERE    │  namespace · scoped SA · quota · default-deny + bounded egress
 └────────────────────────────────────┘
        │  runs the shared agent-runtime image under the managed identity
        ▼
 channel-proxy · artifact · memory-gateway · LiteLLM · Obot   (the only permitted egress)
```

Invariant: the managed identity is never the personal `agent-runtime-*` class and vice versa — the
chart rejects a personal ServiceAccount name at render time, and the namespace must differ from the
server namespace. `automountServiceAccountToken` is `false`; the launcher projects a managed-audience
token explicitly per attempt.

## Public surface

This app has no HTTP or TypeScript API. Its public deployment contract is
`helm/values.yaml`: namespace and ServiceAccount identity, aggregate workload quota, and the exact
components and TCP ports reachable from managed runtime Pods. The chart renders one Namespace,
ServiceAccount, ResourceQuota, default-deny NetworkPolicy, and explicit egress NetworkPolicy.

## Layout

- `helm/` — the standalone chart (`Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `templates/managed-agent-runtime.yaml`).
- `tests/helm-contract.sh` — renders the chart and asserts the distinct SA, aggregate quota,
  default-deny + port-bounded egress policies, restricted namespace, and identity-class fences.
- `deploy/README.md` — image provenance: this plane reuses the `agent-runtime` image.

## Boundary

Deployment-only. It creates no Pods on its own; the control-plane launcher creates managed-runtime
Jobs into this namespace under the managed identity profile.
