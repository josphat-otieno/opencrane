/**
 * Reusable authorization guard for mutations (POST/PUT/DELETE) on ClusterTenant-scoped
 * control-plane resources (Track AIR — provider credentials, model definitions).
 *
 * The rule (AIR.0b), in priority order:
 *   1. A platform operator (session `isPlatformOperator`) may mutate any resource at any scope.
 *   2. A non-operator may mutate only a `clusterTenant`-scoped resource whose owning
 *      ClusterTenant equals the caller's own resolved ClusterTenant. Global-scoped mutations
 *      are operator-only.
 *
 * `clusterTenant` is resolved fresh from the caller's IdP-verified email (email → tenant →
 * `clusterTenantRef`), mirroring `OidcAuthService._resolveClusterTenant` — never taken from a
 * self-asserted claim or request input.
 *
 * The guard is applied per-router and reads the *resource* scope/clusterTenant from the request
 * via the supplied `resolveResource` callback, which is run after the request body / params are
 * available. Reads (GET) are intentionally NOT guarded — any authenticated caller may list/read.
 *
 * @param prisma          - Prisma client used for the fail-closed email→tenant→clusterTenantRef lookup.
 * @param resolveResource - Resolves the scope + owning clusterTenant of the resource the request targets.
 * @returns An Express middleware enforcing the rule above (403 on denial).
