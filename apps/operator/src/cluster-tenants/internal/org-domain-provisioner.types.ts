/**
 * Per-org domain provisioning seam (fixed-wildcard topology), operator side.
 *
 * When an org (ClusterTenant) is reconciled it becomes addressable at its derived
 * apex `<name>.<base>` and its users at `<user>.<name>.<base>`. Two cluster-side side
 * effects must follow:
 *   1. DNS — a per-org wildcard record `*.<name>.<base>` → the cluster ingress IP, so
 *      every UserTenant gateway host under the org resolves with no per-user record.
 *   2. TLS — a per-org wildcard Certificate `*.<name>.<base>` (cert-manager DNS-01),
 *      because the platform `*.<base>` cert does NOT cover the extra label
 *      `<user>.<name>.<base>` (DNS wildcards match exactly one label).
 *
 * The operator owns this seam: it is the reconciler/executor that materialises the
 * cluster state. The concrete implementation is `DefaultOrgDomainProvisioner`
 * (org-domain.provisioner.js), wired by `_BuildOrgDomainProvisioner` from operator
 * config. It is RUNTIME-GATED by real capability detection — when cert-manager is
 * absent (the Certificate CRD is not served) and no Cloud DNS zone is configured, it
 * returns `{ ready:false, skipped:true }` rather than throwing; the reconciler then
 * records a `DomainProvisioningSkipped` condition and the org still reaches `ready`,
 * because the namespace boundary (not the cert) is the openclaw-attachment gate.
