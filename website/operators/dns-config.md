# DNS configuration

This is the operator-facing companion to **[Set up your domain](/guide/dns)**. The guide
walks an admin through the happy path; this page documents the model, the full API/CLI
surface, the cert-manager resources OpenCrane creates, and the per-provider and
multi-instance options.

## The model: one fixed platform wildcard, orgs derived under it

OpenCrane uses a **fixed wildcard topology**. The platform owns **one base domain**
(`<base>`, e.g. `weownai.eu`) and a **fixed super-operator / control-plane host**
(`platform.<base>`). Every org name is **derived** under the base — customers do
not bring their own domain (a vanity domain is an optional overlay):

| Name | Where it points | Set how often |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Control-plane host `platform.<base>` → ingress | platform DNS | once, at install |
| Apex `<base>` → ingress | platform DNS | once, at install |
| Platform wildcard `*.<base>` → ingress (resolves every **org host** `<org>.<base>`) | platform DNS | once, at install |
| Per-org host `<org>.<base>` A record → ingress | emitted by the operator at org provision; external-dns reconciles | automatic, per org |

An org is served at `<org>.<base>` (e.g. `acme.weownai.eu`). There are **no per-user
subdomains** — every user in an org connects through the org's single host. An
identity-routing proxy (folded into the ClusterTenant operator) resolves each user's
session to their own pod and forwards the WebSocket there.

::: tip One wildcard level is enough
Because users share the org host, the platform wildcard `*.<base>` is the only
wildcard record needed. There are no per-org `*.<org>.<base>` wildcard records and
no per-org wildcard DNS-01 challenges.
:::

### Who writes the records: external-dns (runtime substrate)

The platform records (`platform.<base>`, the apex, and the platform wildcard `*.<base>`)
are written **once at install** — by Terraform when it owns the Cloud DNS zone, or by you
at your provider otherwise. Each **org record** (`<org>.<base>`) is written at **runtime**
by the in-cluster **external-dns** controller: the ClusterTenant operator emits an explicit
`<org>.<base>` A record as a namespaced `DNSEndpoint` custom resource
(`externaldns.k8s.io/v1alpha1`) pointing at the ingress IP, and external-dns (run with
`--source=crd`) reconciles that record into the zone — adding it when an org is provisioned
and reaping it when the `DNSEndpoint` (or its namespace) is deleted. The operator therefore
talks to **no cloud DNS API directly**; the record substrate is provider-agnostic. The
install scripts bundle external-dns as a cluster singleton in `acme`/`clouddns` mode
(`--no-external-dns` to BYO a controller); the `externalDns.enabled` chart value gates the
operator's `DNSEndpoint` RBAC.

### The shared zone-write identity

external-dns (writing the org A records) and the cert-manager DNS-01 solver (writing the
temporary `_acme-challenge` `TXT` records for the platform wildcard cert) both need
**write** access to the same zone, so they **share one credential** — there is exactly one
binding, never a per-controller copy:

- **Google Cloud, Workload Identity (default):** one Google service account bound
  `roles/dns.admin` on the zone's project, impersonated by both controllers'
  Kubernetes service accounts. Terraform's `dns` module provisions it.
- **External zone:** hand the same service-account key to both controllers via
  `--dns01-credentials` at install.

### Registrar NS-delegation (one-time)

When Terraform owns the Cloud DNS zone, delegate your domain to that zone's name servers
(the `dns_name_servers` Terraform output) at your **registrar** — an NS delegation. Until
that resolves, both DNS-01 issuance and external-dns reconciliation will hang. The
`./platform/k8s-deploy.sh --preflight` check verifies the delegation resolves before you
install.

### Why a provider token is still needed

The platform wildcard `*.<base>` certificate must be validated with the **ACME DNS-01
challenge** — cert-manager briefly creates a `_acme-challenge.<zone>` `TXT` record. The
provider token you supply is used for **exactly that, and only that**: writing and removing
that temporary validation record. cert-manager then auto-renews (~every 60 days) using the
same token. No per-org DNS-01 is needed — org hosts ride the platform wildcard cert (see
[TLS below](#tls-certificates)).

### Optional: a customer-vanity domain (CNAME)

A customer who wants their **own** domain (e.g. `ai.client-company.com`) does **not**
delegate or transfer it — they add a single `CNAME` at their own provider pointing it at
their org host:

```
# At the customer's DNS provider, for org "acme" on base "weownai.eu":
ai.client-company.com.   CNAME   acme.weownai.eu.
```

Then set the org's `vanityDomain` (`oc cluster-tenant update acme --vanity-domain
ai.client-company.com`, or the `vanityDomain` field on the API). OpenCrane adds the vanity
name to a per-org TLS certificate (an HTTP-01 cert whose SAN is the vanity host) so it is
browser-trusted. The vanity domain is an **overlay**: the org is always also reachable at
its canonical `<org>.<base>` host.

## TLS certificates

| Cert | Covers | Challenge | Issued |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Platform wildcard** `*.<base>` (+ apex + control-plane host) | every org host `<org>.<base>`, the apex, the fixed control-plane host | DNS-01 (wildcard requires DNS-01) | once at install by the chart (`cluster-issuer.yaml`) |
| **Per-org vanity** (SAN = the vanity host only) | the customer-vanity host only | HTTP-01 (no wildcard, so DNS-01 is unnecessary) | at org provision, only when a `vanityDomain` is set |

The platform wildcard cert is the **only** cert that requires DNS-01 and a zone-write
credential. Per-org vanity certs use HTTP-01 — no provider token needed for those.

## Configure it

### CLI

```bash
oc platform dns set \
  --provider cloudflare \
  --zone ai.example.com \
  --email you@example.com \
  --token-file ./cloudflare-token.txt
```

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| `--provider` | yes | DNS-01 solver provider key (`cloudflare`, `digitalocean`, `route53`, `rfc2136`, …) |
| `--zone` | yes | The platform wildcard **base** the cert covers (e.g. `weownai.eu`) — org hosts are `<org>.<base>` |
| `--email` | yes | ACME account contact address (renewal notices) |
| `--server` | no | ACME directory URL (defaults to Let's Encrypt production) |
| `--issuer-name` | no | Issuer name to create/update (defaults to `opencrane-issuer`) |
| `--token-file` | no | File holding the provider API token, for token-based providers |
| `--solver-config-file` | no | JSON file with a raw provider solver block, for non-token providers |

The token and solver config are read from **files**, never passed as arguments, so
secrets never land in shell history or process listings.

Inspect the current configuration at any time:

```bash
oc platform dns show
```

### Providers

| Provider | Credential | How to supply |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `cloudflare` | scoped API token | `--token-file` |
| `digitalocean` | API token | `--token-file` |
| `route53` | IAM keys / role | `--solver-config-file` |
| `rfc2136` | TSIG key | `--solver-config-file` |

Token-based providers (`cloudflare`, `digitalocean`) store the token in a Secret the
solver references. Any other provider supplies its solver block verbatim via
`--solver-config-file` — a JSON object rendered under the provider key. For example, an
`rfc2136` solver config:

```json
{
  "nameserver": "10.0.0.53:53",
  "tsigKeyName": "opencrane-key",
  "tsigAlgorithm": "HMACSHA256",
  "tsigSecretSecretRef": { "name": "rfc2136-tsig", "key": "tsig-secret" }
}
```

The token must be scoped to **edit the delegated zone only** — DNS-01 needs nothing more
than creating and removing `TXT` records in that zone.

## API surface

The CLI is a thin client over a platform-admin endpoint mounted at
`/api/v1/platform/dns` (behind the auth middleware). It is API-first: the CLI is one
client, not a privileged path.

### `PUT /api/v1/platform/dns`

Capture a provider config and apply the cert-manager issuer (+ credentials Secret).

```json
{
  "provider": "cloudflare",
  "zone": "ai.example.com",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "server": null,
  "issuerName": "opencrane-issuer",
  "apiToken": "<token>",
  "solverConfig": null
}
```

`provider`, `zone` and `email` are required. On success it returns the applied summary:

```json
{
  "status": "configured",
  "issuerName": "opencrane-issuer",
  "issuerKind": "ClusterIssuer",
  "issuerNamespace": null,
  "provider": "cloudflare",
  "zone": "ai.example.com",
  "secretName": "opencrane-dns01-cloudflare"
}
```

| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `400` `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `provider`, `zone` or `email` missing |
| `422` `DNS_PROVIDER_MISCONFIGURED` | token-based provider with no token, or non-token provider with no solver block |

### `GET /api/v1/platform/dns`

Report the configured issuer (non-secret fields only). Optional `issuerName` query
parameter selects which issuer to inspect.

```json
{
  "configured": true,
  "issuerName": "opencrane-issuer",
  "issuerKind": "ClusterIssuer",
  "issuerNamespace": null,
  "provider": "cloudflare",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "server": "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
}
```

When no issuer exists (or the cert-manager CRDs are not installed) it returns
`configured: false`. Auth and permission errors are **not** masked as unconfigured — only
a genuine 404 reports `configured: false`.

## What gets created in the cluster

`PUT` idempotently upserts two resources (create, or replace on conflict, so a rotated
token takes effect on re-apply):

1. **A credentials Secret** — `opencrane-dns01-<provider>` (token-based providers only),
   holding the provider token under the `api-token` key.
2. **A cert-manager issuer** — an ACME DNS-01 issuer referencing that Secret (or the raw
   solver block). cert-manager then issues/renews the **platform** wildcard `*.<base>`
   certificate (plus the apex and the control-plane host) into the Secret the chart
   references (`ingress.tls.secretName`, default `opencrane-wildcard-tls`).

This authorises the issuer **on the zone**. The platform wildcard cert covers every org host
`<org>.<base>` — no per-org cert issuance is needed at provision time unless a vanity domain
is set. A per-org vanity cert (HTTP-01) is issued separately when `vanityDomain` is
configured on the ClusterTenant. The certificate appearing in a Secret happens on a live
cluster with real DNS; this endpoint's job is to author and apply the issuer + Secret
correctly.

## Issuer kind: single vs multi-instance

The issuer kind is environment-driven, so the same code serves a single install and
multiple instances sharing one cluster:

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `PLATFORM_DNS_ISSUER_KIND` | `ClusterIssuer` | `ClusterIssuer` = one cluster-wide issuer (solver Secret in the cert-manager namespace). `Issuer` = a per-instance namespaced issuer, so two instances never fight over one cluster-singleton. |
| `PLATFORM_DNS_ISSUER_NAMESPACE` | the pod's `NAMESPACE` | Namespace for a namespaced `Issuer` and its solver Secret (ignored for `ClusterIssuer`). |
| `CERT_MANAGER_NAMESPACE` | `cert-manager` | Namespace a cluster-wide `ClusterIssuer`'s solver Secret is written to. |

In multi-instance mode the Helm chart wires `PLATFORM_DNS_ISSUER_KIND=Issuer`. See
[Running multiple instances](/advanced/multi-instance).

## Local and dev installs

On a laptop install you can skip all of this — local mode does not need real DNS or public
certificates, and dev uses `sslip.io`-style hosts that resolve without a provider.
