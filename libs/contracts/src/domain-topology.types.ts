/**
 * Platform domain topology — the single source of truth for how OpenCrane derives
 * org and user hostnames from one fixed platform wildcard base.
 *
 * The platform owns ONE wildcard base (`<base>`, e.g. `weownai.eu`) under which:
 *   - each org (ClusterTenant) is served at `<org>.<base>`     (the org apex)
 *   - each user (UserTenant) is served at `<user>.<org>.<base>` (the per-user gateway)
 * The fixed super-operator / opencrane-ui host (e.g. `platform.weownai.eu`) is a
 * SEPARATE host, never derived from this base — it is the management API above every
 * org. A customer may optionally CNAME a vanity domain ONTO their `<org>.<base>` apex;
 * the vanity name is an overlay, not the canonical identity.
 *
 * Because DNS wildcards match exactly one label, `*.<base>` covers `<org>.<base>` but
 * NOT `<user>.<org>.<base>`. The per-user level needs its own `*.<org>.<base>`
 * wildcard certificate, issued per org at provision time (see
 * docs/agents/cluster-architecture.md → "Multi-level wildcard TLS").
