 * Build the tenant ConfigMap that carries both OpenClaw runtime configuration

 *
 * The generated ConfigMap serves three purposes:
 * - `openclaw.json` provides the effective OpenClaw gateway/runtime config
 *   after OpenCrane defaults are merged with any tenant overrides.
 * - `opencrane-managed-runtime.json` gives the tenant runtime an explicit
 *   description of the platform context it is running under.
 * - Workspace files (`AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SOUL.md.seed`, etc.) are
 *   seeded into the OpenClaw agent workspace by `entrypoint.sh` on boot.
 *   L0 files (no `.seed` suffix) are re-stamped on every boot; L2 files
 *   (`.seed` suffix) are copied once and then tenant-owned.
 *
 * @param config - Operator runtime configuration.
 * @param tenant - The Tenant CR being reconciled.
 * @param namespace - Namespace the ConfigMap is written to.
 * @param effectivePolicy - The resolved AccessPolicy, when one applies.
 * @param modelSet - The tenant's allowed model set fetched best-effort from the
 *        control-plane, or `null`. When LiteLLM is enabled the `litellm-proxy` provider runs in
 *        `replace` mode (it is the ONLY provider), restricted to these models with the default
 *        surfaced. An empty/null result yields `models: []` — and because there are no built-in
 *        providers to fall back to, the pod then has zero usable models. Cluster onboarding makes
 *        that impossible by requiring ≥1 registered model before a silo is provisioned; a transient
 *        control-plane outage at reconcile is the only window it can occur, and it self-heals on the
 *        next successful fetch.
 * @param servingHost - The host the org's Control UI is served at (`<org>.<base>` or
 *        vanity), used to allowlist the browser Origin in `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins`.
 *        With `bind: lan` the gateway rejects a Control-UI WS whose Origin is not allowlisted
 *        (`CONTROL_UI_ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED`); the SPA reaches the gateway via this host, so its
 *        `https://<host>` origin must be allowed. Omitted ⇒ no origin is added (the gateway's
 *        own localhost seeding applies — the pre-same-origin behaviour).
