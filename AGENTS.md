# OpenCrane Agent Guidance

## Source Of Truth

This file is the canonical agent instruction file for the repository.

- Read this file first when working in the repo.
- Treat legacy guidance in `CLAUDE.md` as redirected here.

## Build And Test

- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- Build all: `pnpm build`
- Test all: `pnpm test`
- Build single package: `pnpm --filter @opencrane/operator build`
- Test single package: `pnpm --filter @opencrane/control-plane test`

## Planning Discipline

- Keep `plan.md` updated as implementation progresses.
- When a roadmap item changes state due to code, validation, or a discovered blocker, update `plan.md` in the same work cycle.
- Do not leave completed or partially implemented backlog items stale in `plan.md` after landing the corresponding code.

## Commit Messages

- Always end each work cycle with a suggested commit message.
- Commit messages must start with a [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) emoji that matches the primary intent of the change.
- Use imperative mood for the subject line (e.g. `add`, `fix`, `update`, not `added` or `adding`).
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
- If the change touches multiple concerns, list them as bullet points in the body.

Common gitmoji prefixes:
| Intent | Emoji |
|--------|-------|
| New feature | ✨ |
| Bug fix | 🐛 |
| Refactor (no behavior change) | ♻️ |
| Documentation | 📝 |
| Tests | ✅ |
| Configuration / tooling | 🔧 |
| Performance | ⚡️ |
| Security | 🔒️ |
| Work in progress | 🚧 |
| Remove code or files | 🔥 |

## TypeScript Coding Guidelines

### Bracket Placement

Opening brackets `{` must be on their own line for classes and functions.

Exception: single-line functions may have the bracket on the same line.

```typescript
// WRONG
export class MyService {
	getData(): string {
		return "data";
	}
}

// CORRECT
export class MyService
{
	getData(): string
	{
		return "data";
	}
}
```

```typescript
function trimString(value: string): string { return value?.trim() ?? ""; }
```

### Arrow Functions

Never use arrow functions to declare standalone functions. Arrow functions are only allowed inside higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

```typescript
// WRONG
const getUserName = (user: User): string => user.name;

// CORRECT
function getUserName(user: User): string
{
	return user.name;
}

// Arrow functions OK inside higher-order functions
const names = users.map(user => user.name);
const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
```

### Self-Review Before Finishing

After writing or editing any TypeScript file, explicitly verify each item below before moving on.
Do **not** rely on "it feels right" — check each rule against the actual code you just wrote.

When a coding turn writes or edits `.ts` files, include a compact compliance table in the response:

| File | No standalone `=>` | Imports single-line at top | All declarations JSDoc (incl. properties) | Types in `*.types.ts` | Naming convention |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `example.ts` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Rules to check:

1. **No standalone arrow functions** — `setInterval`, `Promise`, `new Map()` callbacks must use named `function` expressions, not `() =>`.  Arrow functions are only permitted inside `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `Array.from` (as a mapper), and equivalent pure functional HOFs.
2. **Imports: single-line, all at top** — Every import from a given package on one line. No import statements below the first non-import line. Two separate `import ... from "express"` lines is a violation — merge them.
3. **JSDoc on every declaration, including every interface property and every class field** — not just the enclosing type or class.
4. **Exported interfaces and type aliases in `*.types.ts`** — not in the implementation file.
5. **Function naming** — file-private: `_camelCase`; same-package export: `_PascalCase`; same-domain: `__PascalCase`; wide/global: `___PascalCase`.

The compliance table is **not** optional when TypeScript files were modified. If the table would be incomplete, fix the violations first.

### Mandatory Independent Review (Policy-Driven Gate)

The self-review table above is a self-check and is not sufficient on its own. A
policy-driven `Stop` gate decides — per change — whether an independent review is
required before the turn can end. When the gate asks for review you must:

1. Delegate to the **`@review` subagent** against the changed files.
2. Resolve every **Critical** and **High** finding it returns — fix it, or justify in
   your response why it is not applicable.
3. Only then finish the turn.

**How the gate decides** (two `Stop` hooks run in parallel):

- `.claude/hooks/require-review.sh` — a free shell pre-filter. It skips the obvious
  cases (no TypeScript change, trivial size, test/type-only/generated files,
  already-reviewed) and escalates the rest. It writes `.claude/.review-context.md`
  for the judge.
- A **Haiku agent hook** reads that context plus `.claude/review-policy.md` and judges
  whether the change carries real risk (auth, secrets, network, IAM, money, or
  non-trivial production control flow). It blocks (`ok:false`) only when warranted.

**`.claude/review-policy.md` is the single tunable surface.** If review fires too often
and burns tokens — or misses something — edit that file (threshold, `always-review`
keywords, `never-review-paths`, or the judgment guidance) and record it in its tuning log.

The gate blocks **at most once per stop sequence** (loop-safety via `stop_hook_active`),
so it can never trap a turn — but skipping the review when it fires defeats the purpose.
Treat a block as a hard requirement, not a suggestion.

### Inline Step Comments

Every function with 3 or more sequential steps must have a numbered inline comment before each step.

- The comment must explain what the step does.
- The comment must explain why the step is necessary.
- The comment must not just restate the method name.

```typescript
// WRONG — no comments, reader must infer intent from method names alone
async function provision(tenant: Tenant): Promise<void>
{
	await createServiceAccount(tenant);
	await createBucket(tenant);
	await createDeployment(tenant);
}

// CORRECT — each step is explained with context
async function provision(tenant: Tenant): Promise<void>
{
	// 1. ServiceAccount — grants the pod a GCP identity for Workload Identity.
	await createServiceAccount(tenant);

	// 2. BucketClaim — requests a per-tenant GCS bucket via Crossplane.
	await createBucket(tenant);

	// 3. Deployment — runs the tenant gateway; mounts GCS volume and shared skills.
	await createDeployment(tenant);
}
```

### JSDoc Documentation

All declarations must have JSDoc comments. This includes **every interface property and class field**, not just the containing type or class.

```typescript
/** Service for managing tenant lifecycle */
export class TenantService
{
	/** The currently selected tenant */
	private currentTenant: Tenant | null = null;

	/**
	 * Fetches tenant by name from the cluster
	 * @param name - The tenant CR name
	 * @returns The tenant resource
	 */
	getTenant(name: string): Promise<Tenant>
	{
		return this.customApi.getNamespacedCustomObject({ name });
	}
}

/** Configuration options for the operator */
interface OperatorConfig
{
	/** Namespace to watch for Tenant CRs */
	watchNamespace: string;
	/** Default container image for tenant pods */
	tenantDefaultImage: string;
}
```

**WRONG — properties undocumented:**
```typescript
interface McpServerEntry
{
	id: string;
	name: string;
	endpoint: string;
}
```

**CORRECT — every property documented:**
```typescript
/** A registered MCP server entry returned by the catalog API. */
interface McpServerEntry
{
	/** Stable identifier used for deduplication across polls. */
	id: string;
	/** Human-readable name shown in the UI. */
	name: string;
	/** Fully-qualified URL of the MCP server endpoint. */
	endpoint: string;
}
```

### Type And Interface File Separation

Interfaces and exported types must live in dedicated type files, not mixed with implementation logic.

- Use `*.types.ts` files for exported interfaces, type aliases, and DTO shapes.
- Keep runtime/business logic in separate implementation files.
- If a module needs shared types, import them from its paired `*.types.ts` file.

```typescript
// WRONG: interface and runtime logic mixed in one file
export interface ResolveResult
{
	status: "ok" | "error";
}

export function _Resolve(): ResolveResult
{
	return { status: "ok" };
}

// CORRECT: split files
// resolve.types.ts
export interface ResolveResult
{
	status: "ok" | "error";
}

// resolve.ts
import type { ResolveResult } from "./resolve.types.js";

export function _Resolve(): ResolveResult
{
	return { status: "ok" };
}
```

### Internal Routes Without Auth Middleware

When a route is intentionally excluded from `___AuthMiddleware` and relies on Kubernetes NetworkPolicy for access control instead, the router function must:

1. State this explicitly in its JSDoc with a bolded note.
2. Include a `@see` tag pointing to the Helm NetworkPolicy template that enforces the restriction.
3. Include a second `@see` pointing to the deployment template that wires the caller.

```typescript
/**
 * Internal router for widget delivery.
 *
 * **This router is NOT behind `___AuthMiddleware`.**
 * Access is enforced by Kubernetes NetworkPolicy.
 *
 * @see platform/helm/templates/networkpolicy-planes.yaml — policy restricting
 *   which pods can reach the control-plane service.
 * @see platform/helm/templates/widget-consumer-deployment.yaml — deployment
 *   that sets WIDGET_URL to this endpoint.
 */
export function _RegisterInternalWidgets(prisma: PrismaClient): Router { ... }
```

### Custom HTTP Response Headers

Non-standard response headers (the `X-*` prefix convention) must include an inline comment that explains:

1. **Why** the header is being set — what the receiver does with it.
2. **Which standard or convention** it follows, with a `@see` URL.

The `X-` prefix was deprecated for IANA registration by RFC 6648 but remains the standard practice for private/internal headers.

```typescript
// Content-Type: standard HTTP header (RFC 9110 §8.3) — tells the consumer
// how to parse the response body.
// @see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.3
res.setHeader("Content-Type", bundle.contentType ?? "text/markdown");

// X-Widget-Name / X-Widget-Digest: proprietary identification headers using
// the informal X- prefix (RFC 6648 deprecated IANA use but convention remains
// standard for private headers).  Allow the receiver to cache and forward
// identity without parsing the URL.
// @see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6648
res.setHeader("X-Widget-Name", widget.name);
res.setHeader("X-Widget-Digest", digest);
```

### Function Naming Conventions

Use underscore prefixes to indicate scope and visibility.

- `function _functionName`: same file only
- `function _FunctionName`: same package
- `function __FunctionName`: same domain
- `function ___FunctionName`: wide or global application use

| Pattern | Scope | Usage |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `function _functionName` | Same file only | Local helper consumed within the same file |
| `function _FunctionName` | Same package | Shared within the same workspace package |
| `function __FunctionName` | Same domain | Shared across closely related packages |
| `function ___FunctionName` | Wide/global | Shared across the entire application |

```typescript
// Local to this file only (not exported)
function _formatDate(date: Date): string
{
	return date.toISOString().split("T")[0];
}

// Exported for use within the same package
export function _FormatTitle(title: string): string
{
	return title.trim().toUpperCase();
}

// Exported for use across related packages
export function __FormatStatus(status: string): string
{
	return `STATUS.${status}`;
}

// Exported for wide use across the entire application
export function ___FormatDisplayName(firstName: string, lastName: string): string
{
	return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
}
```

### Import Order

Imports should be ordered from furthest dependency to closest, grouped by family.

- 1. Node builtins
- 2. External utils and helpers
- 3. External frameworks
- 4. Local packages
- 5. Local file imports

```typescript
// 1. External libraries - Utils/Helpers
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import { join } from "node:path";

// 2. External libraries - Framework
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import * as k8s from "@kubernetes/client-node";
import pino from "pino";

// 3. Local packages - Types/Models
import type { Tenant, AccessPolicy, OperatorConfig } from "@opencrane/operator";

// 4. Local file imports (same package)
import { applyResource, deleteResource } from "./reconciler.js";
import type { CreateTenantRequest } from "../types.js";
```

| Priority | Category | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Node builtins | `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:crypto` |
| 2 | External - Utils | `date-fns`, `lodash` |
| 3 | External - Framework | `hono`, `@kubernetes/client-node`, `pino` |
| 4 | Local packages | `@opencrane/operator`, `@opencrane/control-plane` |
| 5 | Local file imports | `./reconciler.js`, `../types.js` |

### Single-Line Imports

All imports from a single package must be on one line.

- Never split a single import declaration across multiple lines.

```typescript
// WRONG
import {
	TenantSpec,
	TenantStatus,
	AccessPolicySpec,
	OperatorConfig,
} from "./types.js";

// CORRECT
import { TenantSpec, TenantStatus, AccessPolicySpec, OperatorConfig } from "./types.js";
```

### Barrel Exports

Each workspace package should have a single barrel export file at the package root (`src/index.ts`).

- Import from the package barrel.
- Do not import from internal package source paths.

```typescript
// CORRECT
import { TenantOperator } from "@opencrane/operator";

// WRONG
import { TenantOperator } from "@opencrane/operator/src/tenant-operator";
```

## IAM-First

OpenCrane is IAM-first.

- Prefer federated identity, Workload Identity, OIDC, and cloud IAM over static bearer tokens.
- Treat bearer tokens as temporary compatibility shims or break-glass paths, not the default architecture.
- Every platform service and every tenant workload should have an explicit workload identity.
- Every human operator should authenticate through centrally managed identity, not shared long-lived tokens.

## Central Identity Model

Identity and authorization must be described centrally.

- Cloud IAM is the source of truth for cloud resource access.
- Kubernetes RBAC is the source of truth for Kubernetes API access.
- Terraform should define cloud identities, trust bindings, and IAM role attachments.
- Helm should define Kubernetes service accounts, RBAC bindings, and workload identity annotations.
- Application code should consume identity provided by the platform rather than inventing parallel auth schemes.

## Defaults

- New services should get a dedicated Kubernetes service account.
- New services should get a dedicated cloud service account when they need cloud API access.
- Disable service account token automount unless Kubernetes API access is explicitly required.
- Scope IAM and RBAC to the smallest role that satisfies the workload.
- Prefer machine-to-machine identity over shared secrets.

## Token Policy

- Do not introduce new bearer-token control paths when IAM or OIDC can solve the problem.
- Existing bearer-token paths should be treated as migration targets.
- If a bearer token is unavoidable, document why IAM cannot be used, constrain its scope, and define a removal path.

## OpenCrane-Specific Direction

- Tenant workloads should use per-tenant Workload Identity for cloud storage and other tenant-scoped cloud resources.
- Operator and control-plane services should move toward explicit workload identities instead of implicit cluster-only trust.
- Network reachability does not imply authorization; authorization should come from IAM and RBAC, not location on the cluster network.

## Frontend Guidelines

### PrimeNG Standard

For Angular frontend work, use PrimeNG as the default component library.

- Prefer PrimeNG form, table, navigation, and feedback components over custom implementations.
- Configure theme providers in `app.config.ts` using `providePrimeNG`.
- Keep global visual tokens in `styles.css`; avoid ad-hoc per-page color systems.

### Reusable Component Rule (Required)

Always create reusable UI components before writing repeated page-level markup.

- Shared visual wrappers must live under `src/app/shared/components/**`.
- Feature pages under `src/app/features/**` should compose shared components and services.
- If the same pattern appears in 2 or more places, refactor it into a shared component immediately.
- Page components should focus on orchestration and data flow; display logic belongs in shared components.
- Check these rules after every implementation cycle.

### Frontend Layering

- `core/`: API services, app-wide models, cross-cutting infrastructure
- `shared/`: reusable presentational components and UI primitives
- `features/`: route-level containers that compose `core` and `shared`

### Data Access

- All HTTP calls must go through dedicated `core/api` services.
- Do not issue HTTP requests directly from templates or shared presentational components.

### Angular Signals, Resources, and Forms

- Prefer `resource(...)` for async read/loading flows in components instead of imperative `ngOnInit` data-fetch logic.
- Prefer `rxResource(...)` / `httpResource(...)` over ad-hoc Promise orchestration when data originates from observables or HTTP.
- Prefer `computed(...)`/`effect(...)` orchestration over manual imperative state transitions when deriving UI state.
- For new or refactored standalone components, prefer `input()` / `output()` over decorator-based `@Input()` / `@Output()` unless Angular requires the decorator form.
- Use signal-driven forms only for new and refactored feature forms.

### Shared Component Size

- Keep shared component classes focused on presentation state and orchestration.
- Move standalone helpers, value parsers, and other pure utilities into sibling `*.utils.ts` files before a shared component grows into multiple concerns.

### Component Template Placement

- Component templates must be defined in separate `*.component.html` files.
- Do not use inline template literals in `@Component` metadata for feature or shared UI components.

### Modern Standalone Angular Imports

- Do not import `CommonModule` or `RouterModule` in standalone components.
- Use modern control flow syntax (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of structural directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`.
- Import standalone router directives directly (for example `RouterLink`, `RouterOutlet`) when templates need routing directives.

### Enum-First UI State

- Avoid magic strings in component decision logic.
- Use enums (for example lifecycle phases) and `switch`-based mapping helpers for status-to-UI conversions.

### Delivery Direction (Pre-Production)

- Do not preserve legacy compatibility paths by default while the platform is pre-production.
- Prefer optimal target architecture and delete superseded legacy branches when refactoring.
