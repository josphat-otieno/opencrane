# Angular / Frontend Guidelines

> Part of the OpenCrane agent guidance. See [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for the index.
>
> **Scope note:** these rules apply to the OpenCrane Angular frontend in `apps/opencrane-ui` and
> `libs/frontend/*`. Some packages were originally ported from WeOwnAI, but the live OpenCrane
> packages, public barrels, and dependency graph are the source of truth here.

## Integration Seam

The frontend is **just another client of the opencrane-server** ([API-first](./app-specific.md#api-first-rule)) — never a privileged path:

- It consumes the public `/api/v1` surface through the generated typed client in `@opencrane/contracts` (`___CreateControlPlaneClient` + `paths`). Don't hand-roll request/response shapes that already exist there.
- It authenticates as a human via an OIDC session and gets no capability the API does not grant every client.
- Any new UI feature must be backed by an API endpoint first; the UI wires to that, it does not introduce opencrane-server behaviour of its own.

## PrimeNG Standard

For Angular frontend work, use PrimeNG as the default component library.

- Prefer PrimeNG form, table, navigation, and feedback components over custom implementations.
- Configure theme providers in `app.config.ts` using `providePrimeNG`.
- Keep global visual tokens in `apps/opencrane-ui/src/styles.scss`; avoid ad-hoc per-page colour
  systems.

## Reusable Component Rule (Required)

Always create reusable UI components before writing repeated page-level markup.

- Domain-agnostic shared visual components must live under `libs/frontend/elements/ui`.
- Feature-specific visual components live under their owning `libs/frontend/features/<capability>`
  package; route-level screens compose them with shared elements and services.
- If the same pattern appears in 2 or more places, refactor it into a shared component immediately.
- Page components should focus on orchestration and data flow; display logic belongs in shared components.
- Check these rules after every implementation cycle.

## Component-manager collaboration gate

Pair frontend implementation with the `component-manager` agent in
`.claude/agents/component-manager.md` whenever adding or materially changing a screen, feature, or
shared visual component.

1. Run `PLAN` before implementation. The component manager inventories the live catalogue and maps
   every screen region to `REUSE`, `EXTEND`, `COMPOSE`, `EXTRACT`, `NEW`, or `KEEP INLINE`.
2. Let the component manager apply shared component APIs, semantic visual states, tokens, and their
   story/fixture, behaviour, accessibility, and screenshot contracts when those changes are needed.
3. Let the frontend implementer own feature orchestration, data access, routing, domain state, and
   assembly of the selected components.
4. Run `POST-DIFF` after implementation. It checks for duplicate primitives, arbitrary styling,
   stale state fixtures, and cohesive components hidden inside a growing screen.

A longer screen triggers a responsibility inventory, not an automatic split. Extract a region when
it has a cohesive input/output or interaction/state contract, independent styling and testability,
independent change pressure, or a visual/markup pattern used in two or more places. Keep one-off
static layout inline when extraction would only fragment the screen.

When a different kind of an existing control is required, extend its typed semantic state or
compose it before creating a second base primitive. Do not use Angular class inheritance merely to
reuse templates or styles; prefer a typed variant, content composition, a narrow wrapper, or a host
directive. Class inheritance is reserved for a genuine stable non-visual behavioural contract.

## Frontend Layering

- `core/`: bottom-layer models, typed HTTP client, theme, and pure utilities.
- `elements/`: reusable presentational components; no feature or state dependency.
- `state/`: gateway ports, adapters, dependency-injection wiring, stores, and caches.
- `features/`: routed screens and panes that compose `elements/` and consume `state/` ports.
- `platform/`: browser/desktop runtime-capability seam supplied by the app.
- `apps/opencrane-ui`: thin browser composition and routing root.

## Routed Page Responsibility Gate

Before adding or materially changing a routed page, inventory these independently changing
responsibilities across its component class, template, styles, state owner, and tests:

1. route parameters and authority-derived navigation;
2. asynchronous reads and refresh/retry state;
3. mutation sequencing, concurrency, idempotency, and conflict recovery;
4. authoritative projection adoption and error translation;
5. server-model to presentation-model mapping;
6. controlled form/interaction state; and
7. visual composition, styling, accessibility, and component-state fixtures.

A routed page may compose components, expose `computed(...)` presentation, delegate typed intents,
and use an `effect(...)` for an external navigation side effect. It must not also own server gateway
calls, mutation lifecycle, retry coordinates, conflict adoption, error translation, and substantial
DTO-to-view mapping. Put those responsibilities in a component-scoped state store and pure feature
mapper; keep cohesive interactive visual regions in feature or shared presentational components.

Do not hide mixed ownership behind generic helpers such as `_run`, `_execute`, `withLoading`, or an
async callback wrapper. Moving the wrapper to another file is not a responsibility split when the
page still decides every command step. When one screen needs both a server read and mutations,
require a store boundary before implementation even when the page remains below the mechanical
module-growth threshold.

## Data Access

- Features consume narrow ports from `state/`; they do not call the HTTP client directly.
- State adapters make HTTP calls through the typed client in `core/api`.
- Do not issue HTTP requests from templates or presentational components.

## Angular Signals, Resources, and Forms

- Prefer `resource(...)` for async read/loading flows in components instead of imperative `ngOnInit` data-fetch logic.
- Prefer `rxResource(...)` / `httpResource(...)` over ad-hoc Promise orchestration when data originates from observables or HTTP.
- Prefer `computed(...)` for values derived wholly from signals, inputs, or resource state; do not mirror them in writable signals and synchronise them through handlers or an `effect(...)`.
- Use `effect(...)` only to bridge reactive state to an external side effect with an explicit lifecycle. Never use it to copy one signal into another or to start a mutation that can rerun as dependencies change.
- For new or refactored standalone components, prefer `input()` / `output()` over decorator-based `@Input()` / `@Output()` unless Angular requires the decorator form.
- Use signal-driven forms only for new and refactored feature forms.

### Reactive state ownership

- Writable signals remain appropriate for controlled input, transient UI state, retry/idempotency coordinates, explicit optimistic state, and command lifecycle. Do not replace these independent states with `computed(...)`.
- A `resource(...)` loader is a read/projection: it must not write server state, navigate, or otherwise cause an external side effect. Keep mutations as explicit commands and include every reactive identity that selects the read in its request/params.
- Model initial load, refresh while retaining a previous value, initial failure, refresh failure, and retry where applicable. Retained data after a failed refresh is not known-fresh data.
- After a mutation, adopt the authoritative returned projection or reload the resource. Do not maintain a second mutable copy of server state merely to predict the same result.

### Lifecycle state components

When one authoritative lifecycle enum selects materially different screens, use one thin routed shell
with one explicit `@switch` and one feature-local component per state.

- The shell owns the authoritative resource, command admission, and adoption of returned projections.
- State components receive read-only state input and emit typed domain intents. They never inject the
  gateway, navigate to simulate advancement, or choose their own next durable state.
- Loading, refresh failure, and reconnecting remain resource/command conditions outside the durable
  lifecycle switch unless the server persists them as domain states.
- Each state component composes approved shared primitives. Extract shared presentation used by two
  state components, but never merge distinct lifecycle components merely because their markup overlaps.
- Unknown states fail visibly. Tests enumerate every owned enum member and prove that the shell renders
  exactly one state component for each member.

### Command concurrency

- Choose concurrency at the authority-conflict scope: prevent duplicate admission of the same intent/target, while allowing independent targets where the server contract permits it. A disabled button alone is not an admission guard.
- Commands that can retry or race across devices carry the server's idempotency, revision, or conflict coordinate. A late completion must not overwrite a newer target, clear another command's busy state, or discard retryable user input.

## Shared Component Size

- Keep shared component classes focused on presentation state and orchestration.
- Move standalone helpers, value parsers, and other pure utilities into sibling `*.utils.ts` files before a shared component grows into multiple concerns.

## Component Template Placement

- Component templates must be defined in separate `*.component.html` files.
- Do not use inline template literals in `@Component` metadata for feature or shared UI components.

## Modern Standalone Angular Imports

- Do not import `CommonModule` or `RouterModule` in standalone components.
- Use modern control flow syntax (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of structural directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`.
- Import standalone router directives directly (for example `RouterLink`, `RouterOutlet`) when templates need routing directives.

## Enum-First UI State

- Avoid magic strings in component decision logic.
- Use enums (for example lifecycle phases) and `switch`-based mapping helpers for status-to-UI conversions.

## Delivery Direction (Pre-Production)

- Do not preserve legacy compatibility paths by default while the platform is pre-production.
- Prefer optimal target architecture and delete superseded legacy branches when refactoring.
