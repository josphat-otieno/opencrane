# OpenCrane — Active Plan

> **Rebased 2026-07-18: direct personal-agent product refactor.** OpenCrane is still being built;
> there is no production estate to preserve or transition. Implementation detail lives in linked
> GitHub issues; this file is the sequencing index. Completed history lives in `plan-done.md` and
> the git history of this file.

## Decision record (2026-07-18)

The [personal-agent platform architecture](docs/design/personal-agent-platform-architecture.md) is
the target:

1. **Product:** OpenCrane owns Thread, Message, Run, RunEvent, approvals, transcript, compaction,
   retries, budgets, identity, memory, artifacts, and tool policy. The runtime is a replaceable
   workload behind a **language-neutral** `AgentRuntimeProtocol v1` ([ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-language-neutral-agent-runtime.md));
   `pydantic-ai-slim` (Python) is the first qualification candidate for the bounded model/tool loop,
   adopted only after it passes the live-LiteLLM conformance gate. Language is not a product contract.
2. **Delivery:** refactor the repository directly to the target state. Delete OpenClaw and every
   obsolete schema, protocol, app, bridge, token path, database assumption, configuration switch,
   test, deployment unit, and document as its replacement becomes ready. Do not preserve, transform,
   or bridge existing OpenCrane state; build only the target product path. Historical transition
   proposals are rejected.
3. **Sequencing:** Phase A deletion debt and Phase B monorepo normalization are complete. Build the
   target foundations and fresh provisioning next; then the runtime and AgentService planes; then
   product surfaces; finally qualify the complete product and verify zero legacy residue.
   Phase gates and their PRs land sequentially on the root workstream branch
   `own-personal-ai-agent-setup`; independent
   work lanes inside the active phase run in parallel where their dependency graph allows.
4. **Architecture:** Postgres is product authority; artifacts live behind `ArtifactStore` on PVC;
   authorization is per silo with proof-bound run/action capabilities; runtimes receive no
   Kubernetes mutation RBAC; Cilium/default-deny enforces workload isolation; Python Jobs are
   isolated; controller and channel-proxy trust boundaries are separate apps; legacy CRDs and
   OpenClaw authorities disappear.

Toolkit selection remains evidence-driven: the offline Phase E conformance harness, immutable
managed run admission and tagged personal/managed input contract, fault-injection matrix,
controller, and runtime boundaries are built and CI-runnable. Live PostgreSQL, Obot, Cognee, and
LiteLLM qualification remains gated on
[#337](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/337)
(→ [#246](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/246)); only passing evidence adopts the
exact-pinned driver and permits deletion of the replaced live path.

## Current state

The silo foundations (S1–S6) are merged: fleet/silo separation, Zitadel-backed membership,
organization OIDC, scope vocabularies, BYOK provider keys, same-origin ingress, and Cognee-backed
organization memory. These are reusable only where they match the adopted target contracts.
OpenClaw-coupled behavior and retired domain contracts are deletion candidates, not compatibility
requirements.

## Program — personal-agent platform

Issues are cut when a phase opens. Each phase ends with architecture, reaper, validation, and
independent-review gates before its PR is merged.

### Phase A — deletion debt — ✅ COMPLETE (see `plan-done.md`)

The `oc` CLI and other confirmed deletion debt were removed. Remaining legacy paths are deleted in
the phase that replaces their responsibility.

### Phase B — monorepo topology: apps are lightweight rollups — ✅ COMPLETE (see `plan-done.md`)

Every deployable or Job class must have one `apps/<name>` owner or a deployment-only
`apps/_infra/<name>` owner; reusable behaviour belongs in functional `libs/*` packages with
enforced dependency direction.

### Phase C — target contracts and app ownership — ✅ COMPLETE (see `plan-done.md`)

Canonical agent, transcript, authorization, membership, persona, artifact, storage, update, and
workload-identity contracts now define the Phase D implementation boundary. The binding decision is
[ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-target-agent-contracts-and-workload-identity.md).

### Repository cohesion — ✅ COMPLETE (see `plan-done.md`)

Deployment-only app owners now live under `apps/_infra`, OpenCrane's installation chart is
`apps/_infra/deploy-k8s`, reusable server domains are grouped under `libs/backend/server`, and
process-supporting server internals are isolated under `libs/backend/server/infra`. This is a direct
path and ownership refactor; it adds no compatibility aliases and changes no runtime behaviour.

### Phase D — foundations, identity, and fresh provisioning

Build the target Postgres models for AgentService/Revision/Run, Thread/Message/RunEvent, Approval,
Persona, Artifact, SkillRevision, audit, and membership projection. Build the authorization facade,
proof-bound capabilities, channel proxy, agent controller, ArtifactStore CAS, outbox, app-owned
Cognee/Obot adapters, default-deny Cilium profiles, workload identities, and deterministic creation
of fresh application stores and credentials. Every durable store uses an expandable mounted volume;
agent-runtime storage is mounted scratch and never the long-term home for user data.

Delete replaced legacy schemas, Tenant/AccessPolicy authority, OpenClaw imports, static agent-token
paths, broad secret broadcasts, obsolete topology switches, and unowned deployables in the same
slices. CI rejects reintroduction. [#117](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/117) supplies
the enforcing-CNI work; [#221](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/221) generalizes the
identity matrix; [#128](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/128) becomes the target Obot
adapter and fresh user-authorized integration flow — seeded by porting PR #241's reviewed Obot
custody/credential/discovery slices from `main` per
[#255](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/255).

Exit: a fresh environment is created from reviewed target artifacts alone; IAM and network negative
tests fail closed; backup/restore reconstructs target-owned stores; no legacy contract is reachable.

### Phase E — personal runtime and AgentService plane (core runtime built; phase incomplete)

**Core runtime built and CI-qualified:** the dependent PR stack now defines immutable run input, the fenced runtime protocol,
the outbound-only runtime process, the suspended one-Job-per-attempt resource contract, and a
crash-safe controller boundary that exactly creates/adopts suspended Jobs before persisting their
Kubernetes UID as the pending assignment. This dependent slice adds a durable release claim,
conditionally unsuspends only that assigned Job, and records its unique first Pod before bootstrap
exchange can begin. A further dependent slice adds cancellation-owned cleanup of abandoned
suspended Jobs: a nonterminal `Cancelling` run state fences the current assignment, proof key, and
pending approvals before any Job is touched; `PrismaRunCancellationRepository` then issues an
assigned or delayed-orphan cleanup claim, and only its confirmed deletion or authoritative absence
moves the run to `Cancelled`. The runtime protocol and channel-target admission fences close on
`cancelling` the same way they close on a terminal state. Bootstrap exchange and the full runtime
command lifecycle now land: the dispatch authority mints `start_attempt`, `resume_attempt`, and a
positive `cancel_attempt` stop signal (with exactly-once terminal reporting under a race); the runtime
surfaces model tool calls as external-action candidates validated against the immutable snapshot and
reserved before dispatch through an injected tool-invocation authority. A tool grant flagged
`requiresApproval` defers: the reserved invocation opens a pending `ApprovalRequest`, so the
pause is reachable end to end. The owner-bound approval-DECISION and steering-INGEST APIs are built:
an owner may decide only their own pending tool approval or queue bounded text only to their own live
run. The deferred-tool DECIDE authority and steering queue feed a fenced, single-use resume command;
the runtime absorbs the queued steering only at safe pre-model boundaries. The
runtime also writes encrypted, version-tagged, replaceable LOCAL checkpoints subordinate to canonical
state (no server-side checkpoint model). The MCP and sandbox execution ports remain fail-closed in
the production composition root. The authenticated memory transport IS composed: the server mounts
its audience-bound projected token and shares one gateway client between admission and dispatch.
Admission-time recall freezes gateway-selected fact references (id + content digest, never text)
into the personal `RunInputSnapshot`, and compile-time statement loading re-resolves and
digest-verifies every reference before inlining it — so redelivered `start_attempt` frames stay
byte-identical or fail closed. Mid-run recall through the external-action executor remains gated:
`AgentRuntimeProtocol v1` has no attempt-fenced ephemeral tool-result channel, and persisted
`ToolInvocation` receipts must not duplicate Cognee fact content. Record, correction, forgetting,
and scoped injection also remain fail-closed pending a recoverable gateway write lifecycle.

**MEMORY TRANSPORT COMPOSED; ADMISSION+COMPILE RECALL LIVE; MID-RUN RECALL AND WRITES STILL GATED**

The offline conformance harness and fault-injection matrix are built and CI-runnable (runtime protocol/reliability, attempt-scoped
credential rejection, observability evidence). The live-LiteLLM conformance leg and driver-adoption
evidence remain gated on [#337](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/337). The remaining
E1/E2 product capabilities below are also incomplete.

**Runtime lane** (→ [#246](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/246)): implement
`RunInputSnapshot`, the TypeScript-owned prompt compiler, the language-neutral `AgentRuntimeProtocol v1`
([ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-language-neutral-agent-runtime.md)), independently authored target fixtures,
Pydantic-AI-first qualification against the target LiteLLM matrix, one exact-pinned driver, the reliability envelope,
interview-generated PersonaRevision and PreferenceFact learning, multimodal and document authoring,
and governed Python skill Jobs
([#222](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/222),
[#243](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/243)).

**AgentService lane:** implement AgentService/Revision/Run, organization/department/team/project/
personal/user sharing, schedules, one-attempt Jobs, approvals, effective access, audit, cost, and the
one-way personal→managed boundary ([#129](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/129)).
**Central agents** — org-, department-, team-, or otherwise shared managed AgentServices that run on a
schedule or a specific trigger to do one bounded task — run on the same runtime substrate as personal
agents but under a narrower, connector-scoped workload identity independent of any human user. They
reach external systems only through Obot-custodied MCP servers, instantiable per connected source. The
legacy ingestion interval worker and its direct Cognee writes are deleted.
Conversation-initiated config changes (always-granted `upgrade_session` tool,
logged persona refresh, apply-at-next-snapshot) → [#318](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/318).

**Central-agents sub-lane** (slice 6, [#332](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/332) — closes
[#129](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/129)): BUILT (offline) — the scheduler semantics
(`backend-server-agent-scheduling`, composed inside `apps/opencrane`: cron+timezone eval, missed-run
catch-up, overlap/backoff/suspension, idempotent run creation through the existing
`ManagedRunAdmissionPort` with `trigger: schedule`), the `AgentServiceSchedule` model + management
API, the connector-scoped managed identity (`managed-agent-runtime-*` SA class + distinct token
audience, the launcher's selectable identity profile, and the chart-only `apps/managed-agent-runtime`
plane), execution authority via the reserve-before-dispatch tool boundary with the Obot transports
composed (authenticated custody provisioning + a per-attempt Obot key scoped to the run's MCP server
ids; approved calls execute runtime→Obot directly with digest-only `tool.completed` receipts,
allow-list enforced), the scoped-memory
contract freezes the gateway-native dataset selected by admitted authority while the authenticated
read transport is built but not connected to runtime execution pending attempt-fenced ephemeral
result delivery, and the attach-authority + runtime
effective-access intersection over the grant compiler (closes the slice-5 deferral; scope-isolation
tested). Scoped injection and personal record/correct/forget remain fail-closed pending a durable,
recoverable gateway write lifecycle. NOT done — a NAMED LATER GATE: **create and qualify the harvesting central agent against
live Obot**, tracked under [#337](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/337); the composed
custody + direct attempt-key data plane validates Obot responses defensively until that live
qualification pins the exact shapes. The repository
does not retain an unqualified offline definition alongside that live acceptance gate.

Here, **built and CI-qualified** means the source, contracts, fault tests, and rendered deployment
artifacts pass without depending on a live external environment. It does not mean PostgreSQL,
Kubernetes Jobs, LiteLLM, Obot, Zitadel login, TLS, recovery, or isolation have passed together on a
real cluster.

**Live qualification status (2026-08-06):** the app-owned Terraform path created the regional
Autopilot cluster `opencrane-dev` wholly in `europe-west1`; ingress-nginx, cert-manager, and
CloudNativePG are live and Ready through the locked prerequisite bootstrap. The dedicated
`testv2.dev.opencrane.ai` record resolves publicly to the reserved ingress address, the confidential
Zitadel OIDC application and client Secret are configured, and the namespace now has four distinct
PostgreSQL bootstrap Secrets. The corrected deploy preflight accepts `dev.opencrane.ai` as the
authoritative record subtree (not a separately delegated child zone), and `standard-rwo` is the
default expandable class. GKE reports regional SSD quota at `230/500 GiB` (270 GiB free); the
project has no default Compute Engine KMS key, so this deployment cannot qualify the CMEK
durable-storage gate.

The first real `testv2` release created and kept its namespace, CNPG Cluster/PgBouncer, ingress,
certificate, UI, Cognee, LiteLLM, and Obot gateway. PostgreSQL and its original privileges hook
completed. The release exposed an invalid architecture assumption: its server treated every silo as
Fleet-attached and required an external `public-key.pem`, despite this test being a standalone
ClusterTenant. The deployment contract now has explicit `standalone` and `fleet` membership modes;
`standalone` removes the Fleet Secret/key mount and starts without converting an OIDC session into
membership, so runtime admission remains fail-closed until a local issuer is built. The initial
channel-proxy and memory-gateway image references did not exist. CI now publishes both from `d2f26df0` under immutable
`sha-d2f26df0` tags, and the complete CI run is green, including Terraform's read-only provider
lock validation.

The server-image CI is now green and published immutable `sha-ffc4dfc`. The live single-silo
deployment is healthy: the app-owned deploy script uses current chart sources rather than stale
local archives; all server database clients use the CNPG Pooler ClusterIP; GKE Dataplane V2 admits
that Service and DNS through port-limited egress while the Pooler ingress policy names its three
approved clients. The server is Ready with a healthy Prisma query, public `/healthz` returns
`{"status":"ok","db":true}`, and its liveness no longer restarts an otherwise recoverable database
path. `testv2.dev.opencrane.ai` now has a browser-trusted Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 certificate and the
login endpoint redirects to the configured Zitadel confidential client. The privileges proof remains
intact: Autopilot provisions its isolated ComputeClass node and the three-container Job completes;
this cold-node/image-pull delay is operational friction, not an application memory leak. The final
monthly cost, CMEK durable-storage gate, browser completion of the Zitadel callback, runtime-job
execution/isolation, local standalone membership issuer for runnable personal/managed agents, and
the wider Phase E live-LiteLLM/Obot/recovery qualification remain open live gates.

**Live single-silo update (2026-08-07):** `testv2` now runs OpenCrane Helm revision 32 and PostgreSQL
revision 49. The CI-published server image `sha-fc53af6` and artifact-service image `sha-7ebcfa8`
are Ready; every deployment is Available, and public `/healthz` returns
`{"status":"ok","db":true}` and `/api/v1/auth/login` redirects to the configured Zitadel confidential
client. The immutable standalone first-owner contract is live: only the verified
`jente@elewa.ke` subject from `https://weownai-oidc-8dwlat.eu1.zitadel.cloud/` may create the local
Owner membership for ClusterTenant `testv2`; it creates the membership and its audit record in one
transaction. A real callback exposed and the regression test now prevents a Prisma selector from
including the in-memory `mayCreateOwner` authorization flag; the corrected image is live. The
deployment also retains the existing OIDC Secret and seeds OpenAI through LiteLLM.
This clears the single-silo deployment, TLS, OIDC configuration, database-privileges, initial-provider,
local first-owner admission, and full workload-health gates. A real callback returned successfully and
created the active `testv2` Owner row. Its first rendered `/no-tenant` page was a separately stale SPA
(`latest`) calling a removed endpoint; CI now publishes the UI on demand and Helm revision 33 pins
`opencrane-ui:sha-6a09541`. Personal-agent/workspace creation and Phase E runtime qualification remain
open live gates.

**Live silo update (2026-08-10):** `testv3` is now the active development silo. Its tenant-prefixed
main, artifact, skill-authoring, and tool namespaces remain deployed and every application,
PostgreSQL, pooler, and dynamic MCP workload is Ready/Running. The superseded `testv2` DNS and
Zitadel callback/origin/logout entries were retired, then its four legacy namespaces were deleted
through a reviewed, UID- and full-inventory-bound app-owned retirement path. The one-time legacy
script was removed after its evidence was recorded in the deploy ledger.

Repository train `0.8.0` also replaces the earlier fresh-database-only decision with explicit
version-to-version authority. Every Nx application records the last root train that adapted its
production contract, directly or through its dependency graph; immutable release manifests map the
compatible app, chart, and database revisions. Adjacent minor trains carry reviewed Helm transitions
and a bounded, backup-gated database migration Job. Patch, skipped-minor, and major transitions stay
manual. The `0.7.0` to `0.8.0` SQL path migrates empty legacy persona state automatically and fails
closed with `OC708` when semantic mapping of populated persona data requires an operator-reviewed
manual plan.

Exit: the canonical runtime and managed-agent lifecycle pass failure, replay, authorization,
isolation, cancellation, provider, and artifact tests with no OpenClaw compatibility surface.

### Phase F — product and operator surfaces

Deliver one OpenCrane API/UI for conversation, persona, memory, agent catalog and revisions,
schedules and runs, approvals, assets, skills, membership, effective-access explanation, audit,
health, model/cost/budget, and runtime versions
([#224](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/224),
[#226](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/226)). Upstream consoles remain diagnostic.

**Current implementation status:** the Angular shell has same-origin OIDC/session guards and early
operator screens for catalogue, access policy, and model keys. Persona sorting now runs through the
target API and authoritative `/onboarding` shell: an owner can answer the reviewed
interview, resolve ties, inspect the derived immutable persona, and approve it into durable onboarding
state. Bootstrap chat, main-app admission and fencing, conversation/thread/prompt streaming, memory,
run history, schedules, membership, audit, assets, skills, and the remaining approval journeys are
still incomplete. Tool/OAuth success is not backed by the real exchange, and there is no full
route-level browser end-to-end suite. The production Angular build, focused feature tests, and
Storybook regression catalogue are green, but they do not qualify the remaining product journeys.

Exit: named end-to-end user and operator journeys work only through the target APIs and UI;
parallel legacy product surfaces are deleted.

### Phase G — product qualification and zero-residue verification

Provision a clean environment and run the complete acceptance matrix: personal memory and persona,
transcript recovery, tools and approvals, grants and membership staleness, artifacts, multimodal and
document workflows, skill isolation, schedules, provider failover, load/cost, security, backup/
restore, observability, and on-call runbooks. Zero Critical/High findings and all named critical
journeys passing are release gates. Future application rollout tests must reach ready target Pods in
under five minutes per silo while remounting existing durable storage.

Verify that the owning replacement slices already deleted OpenClaw runtime/config/protocol/plugin/
workspace surfaces, legacy CRDs and schemas, projections, `feat-skill-registry`,
`feat-central-agents`, Zot-only paths, Linkerd, obsolete topology values, old images/secrets/docs/
tests, and temporary feature-prefixed naming. Any remaining item blocks qualification and is removed
in its owning replacement phase, not deferred here
([#227](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/227),
[#231](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/231)). Update README, CHANGELOG, website,
runbooks, generated clients, and CI forbidden-reference checks.

Exit: a fresh checkout builds and deploys only the target product. Operators have one supported path
to create, share, schedule, observe, revoke, and delete agents and assets.

  measured target workload, security, and cost evidence.
- A generic plugin framework remains deferred until at least two concrete target modules require the
  same extension seam.
- Lightweight model-call traceability remains deferred to
  [#513](https://github.com/elewa-git/opencrane/issues/513): prefer LiteLLM-native OTLP GenAI spans
  through an operator-supplied collector, with prompt and response content disabled by default.
