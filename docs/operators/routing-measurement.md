# Routing Shadow-Measurement (AIR.6) — Operator Recipe

Shadow measurement runs a cheaper **candidate** model and the current **baseline** model against a
skill's golden eval cases, grades both with an independent judge, and estimates the % cost saved at
equal quality. It **never** changes live routing — a positive result emits a *Pending* proposal that
awaits explicit human approval.

This doc covers turning the seams on and driving a measurement end-to-end with the `oc` CLI.

## 1. Environment

The live seams stay **off** (a safe no-op) unless all three are set; with any unset, a measurement
run returns `unconfigured` and records nothing.

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LITELLM_ENDPOINT` | Base URL of the LiteLLM proxy. `/v1/chat/completions` is appended for candidate/baseline/judge calls. |
| `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY` | Bearer credential for LiteLLM. Without it there is no runner and no judge. |
| `ROUTING_JUDGE_MODEL` | The fixed, independent judge model used to grade outputs. **Must be vendor-neutral** — never a sibling of the candidate's family (a candidate self-graded by its own family biases the measurement). |

LiteLLM itself needs a database so it can track per-response cost and serve DB-registered models
(per AIR.0):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://…       # LiteLLM's own Postgres
STORE_MODEL_IN_DB=true          # so `oc model add` registrations are persisted/served
```

The runner reads each run's USD cost from the `x-litellm-response-cost` response header; when it is
absent the cost degrades to `0` (logged as a warning) rather than failing the run.

## 2. Register a model

```
oc model add \
  --name my-cheap-model \
  --upstream openai/gpt-4o-mini \
  --credential <providerCredentialId>
```

`--name` is the routable public slug, `--upstream` the model the deployment targets, and
`--credential` the provider credential backing it (`--api-base` overrides the endpoint for
self-hosted/proxied deployments). Registration is global; per-tenant access is scoped later via
virtual-key allowlists.

## 3. Add per-skill eval cases

Add a golden suite for the skill you want to measure. Each case carries an `input`, an optional
`expected` answer/rubric, and a `qualityBar` the candidate's judge score must clear to count as a
pass.

```
oc routing eval-case add \
  --skill-name summarise --skill-scope org \
  --input '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Summarise: …"}]}' \
  --expected "A two-sentence summary covering …" \
  --quality-bar 0.8
```

`--input` is arbitrary JSON. If it is an object with a `messages` array it is sent verbatim; a bare
string becomes a single user turn; anything else is JSON-stringified into one user message.

## 4. Run a measurement

```
oc routing measurement run \
  --skill-name summarise \
  --candidate-model my-cheap-model
```

This runs every eval case through both the resolved baseline and the candidate, grades the
candidate with `ROUTING_JUDGE_MODEL`, estimates savings with a bootstrap confidence interval, and
persists a `RoutingMeasurement`. If the savings CI excludes zero it also persists a *Pending*
`RoutingProposal`.

## 5. Read the result

```
oc routing measurement list --skill-name summarise
oc routing recommendation list           # surfaced proposals awaiting approval
```

A measurement reports `sampledCalls`, `projectedSavingsPct`, and the CI bounds (`ciLowPct` /
`ciHighPct`). Apply happens only on approval of the proposal — the loop never auto-applies.

## Caveats

- **Vendor-neutral judge.** Keep `ROUTING_JUDGE_MODEL` independent of every candidate family. Grading
  a candidate with a sibling of itself inflates its score.
- **Calibrate against a human slice.** LLM-as-judge grading carries position/verbosity bias (it tends
  to reward longer or first-presented answers). Treat the absolute savings magnitude as indicative
  until you have calibrated the judge's scale against a human-graded subset of the eval suite.
