/**
 * Per-org domain provisioning seam (#151 item 2), silo side.
 *
 * This repo's fixed topology is SINGLE-HOST-PER-ORG: an org (ClusterTenant) is served at
 * its DERIVED apex `<org>.<platformBase>` and every user in the org connects through that
 * ONE host — the in-process gateway proxy routes each connection to the right pod, so
 * there is NO per-user `<user>.<org>.<base>` subdomain (see `_ResolveOrgServingDomain`).
 * That collapses the per-org domain work to two minimal, idempotent side effects, both
 * declared as namespaced custom resources the reconciler owns — NO cloud SDK, NO direct
 * DNS-provider calls:
 *
 *   1. DNS — one EXPLICIT A record `<org>.<base>` → the cluster ingress IP, declared as an
 *      external-dns `DNSEndpoint` CR and reconciled into whatever DNS provider the platform
 *      runs (Cloud DNS, Route53, Cloudflare, RFC2136, …).
 *   2. TLS — the canonical host `<org>.<base>` is one label under the platform base, so it
 *      is already covered by the platform's own `*.<base>` / control-plane certificate; the
 *      ONLY per-org certificate issued here is for an optional customer-VANITY host (a
 *      CNAME the customer points at the ingress), via cert-manager HTTP-01.
 *
 * Ported from the (now fleet-owned, WeOwnAI-repo) `fleet-operator`'s OrgDomainProvisioner so
 * a STANDALONE silo (no external fleet) can provision its own org's domain. The concrete
 * implementation is `DefaultOrgDomainProvisioner` (`org-domain.provisioner.js`), wired by
 * `_BuildOrgDomainProvisioner` from the caller's cert-manager issuer config. It is
 * RUNTIME-GATED by real capability detection — when cert-manager is absent (the Certificate
 * CRD is not served) AND external-dns is absent (the DNSEndpoint CRD is not served), it
 * returns `{ ready:false, skipped:true }` rather than throwing, so a silo without either
 * backend installed still reconciles cleanly.
